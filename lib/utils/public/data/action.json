This amount is determined using Table 4–2: Income Earned, based on your proficiency rank in Crafting and using your own level instead of a task level. After any of these downtime days, you can complete the item by spending the remaining portion of its Price in materials.

The components that appear in this book are listed below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"command\">Command</h3>\n<p>This component is a specific utterance you must make in a loud and strong voice. Activate an Item gains the <a href=\"/traits/16\">auditory</a> and <a href=\"/traits/32\">concentrate</a> traits. You must be able to speak to provide this component.</p>\n<h3 id=\"envision\">Envision</h3>\n<p>This component is a specific image or phenomenon you need to imagine. Activate an Item gains the <a href=\"/traits/32\">concentrate</a> trait.</p>\n<h3 id=\"interact\">Interact</h3>\n<p>This component works like the <a href=\"/actions/80\">Interact</a> basic action. Activate an Item gains the <a href=\"/traits/104\">manipulate</a> trait and requires you to use your hands, just like with any Interact action.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cast-a-spell\">Cast a Spell</h3>\n<p>If an item lists “Cast a Spell” after “Activate,” the activation requires you to use the <a href=\"/actions/72\">Cast a Spell</a> activity to Activate the Item. This happens when the item replicates a spell. You must have a spellcasting class feature to Activate an Item with this activation component. If the item can be used for a specific spell, the action icon for that spell is provided. If it's an item like a staff, which can be used for many spells, the icon is omitted, and you must refer to each spell to determine which actions you must spend to Activate the Item to cast it.</p>\n<p>In this case, Activate an Item gains all the traits from the relevant components of the Cast a Spell activity.</p>\n"

You automatically find any special feature that doesn’t require a check to find, and you attempt the appropriate checks to find hidden special features.</p>\n<p>For instance, if you were looking for an obvious rock formation among some hills, you would spend 2 hexploration activities to Reconnoiter the hex, and you’d find the rock formation. But if you were looking for a hidden tengu monastery somewhere in some deep forests, after spending 2 activities to Reconnoiter the forest hex, you would have to succeed at a Perception check as part of your Reconnoiter activity to find the monastery.</p>\n"

    "description": "<p>Retraining offers a way to alter some of your character choices, which is helpful when you want to take your character in a new direction or change decisions that didn't meet your expectations. You can retrain feats, skills, and some selectable class features. You can't retrain your ancestry, heritage, background, class, or ability scores. You can't perform other downtime activities while retraining.</p>\n<p>Retraining usually requires you to spend time learning from a teacher, whether that entails physical training, studying at a library, or falling into shared magical trances. Your GM determines whether you can get proper training or whether something can be retrained at all. In some cases, you'll have to pay your instructor.</p>\n<p>Some abilities can be difficult or impossible to retrain (for instance, a sorcerer can retrain their bloodline only in extraordinary circumstances).</p>\n<p>When retraining, you generally can't make choices you couldn't make when you selected the original option. For instance, you can't exchange a 2nd-level skill feat for a 4th-level one, or for one that requires prerequisites you didn't meet at the time you took the original feat. If you don't remember whether you met the prerequisites at the time, ask your GM to make the call. If you cease to meet the prerequisites for an ability due to retraining, you can't use that ability. You might need to retrain several abilities in sequence in order to get all the abilities you want.</p>\n<h2 id=\"feats\">Feats</h2>\n<p>You can spend a week of downtime retraining to swap out one of your feats. Remove the old feat and replace it with another of the same type. For example, you could swap a skill feat for another skill feat, but not for a wizard feat.</p>\n<h2 id=\"skills\">Skills</h2>\n<p>You can spend a week of downtime retraining to swap out one of your skill increases. Reduce your proficiency rank in the skill losing its increase by one step and increase your proficiency rank in another skill by one step. The new proficiency rank has to be equal to or lower than the proficiency rank you traded away. For instance, if your bard is a master in <a href=\"/skills/12\">Performance</a> and <a href=\"/skills/15\">Stealth</a>, and an expert in <a href=\"/skills/11\">Occultism</a>, you could reduce the character's proficiency in Stealth to expert and become a master in Occultism, but you couldn't reassign that skill increase to become legendary in Performance. Keep track of your level when you reassign skill increases; the level at which your skill proficiencies changed can influence your ability to retrain feats with skill prerequisites.</p>\n<p>You can also spend a week to retrain an initial trained skill you gained during character creation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"class-features\">Class Features</h2>\n<p>You can change a class feature that required a choice, making a different choice instead. Some, like changing a spell in your spell repertoire, take a week. The GM will tell you how long it takes to retrain larger choices like a druid order or a wizard school—always at least a month.</p>\n"

The effects of the spell don't occur immediately but are imbued into your attack instead. Make a melee Strike with a weapon or <a href=\"/traits/199\">unarmed</a> attack. Your spell is coupled with your attack, using your attack roll result to determine the effects of both the Strike and the spell. This counts as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty, but you don't apply the penalty until after you've completed the Spellstrike. The infusion of spell energy grants your Strike the <a href=\"/traits/11\">arcane</a> trait, making it <a href=\"/traits/103\">magical</a>.</p>\n<p>After you use Spellstrike, you can't do so again until you recharge your Spellstrike as a single action, which has the <a href=\"/traits/32\">concentrate</a> trait. You also recharge your Spellstrike when you cast a conflux spell that takes at least 1 action to cast; casting a focus spell of another type doesn't recharge your Spellstrike.</p>\n<h2 id=\"spellstrike-specifics\">Spellstrike Specifics</h2>\n<p>Though the base Spellstrike rules cover most spells, various modifications apply to more complicated spells when loaded into your fist, blade, or other attack.</p>\n<p><strong>One Target</strong>: The spell targets only the target of your Strike, even if it normally allows more targets. Some feats let you affect more creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Reach</strong>: The coupled spell affects the target using the reach of the weapon or unarmed attack you make your Spellstrike with. For instance, <a href=\"/spells/283\">shocking grasp</a> would affect a creature beyond the reach of your hand if you used a weapon with <a href=\"/traits/192\">reach</a>, and <a href=\"/spells/245\">ray of frost</a> would affect only a creature in your weapon's reach, even though the spell's range is longer.</p>\n<p><strong>Ancillary Effects</strong>: Your spell still has any non-targeted effects that might affect creatures other than the target, as well as any ongoing effects starting from the moment you hit with the Strike. For example, <a href=\"/spells/3\">acid splash</a> would still deal its splash damage to creatures other than the target and <a href=\"/spells/330\">tanglefoot</a>'s circumstance penalty would last for its normal duration. The spell takes effect after the Strike deals damage; if the Strike has other special effects, the GM determines whether they happen before or after the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple Defenses</strong>: Any additional rolls after the initial spell attack still happen normally, such as the Fortitude save attempted by the target of a <a href=\"/spells/76\">disintegrate</a> spell. Similarly, a spell that allows you to attack with it again on subsequent rounds would only combine a Strike with its initial attack roll, not with any later ones.</p>\n<p><strong>Invalid or Immune Target</strong>: If the target you hit wouldn't be a valid target for the spell, the spell is still expended but doesn't affect the target. If the target is immune to your attack but not the spell, it can still be affected by the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Variable Actions</strong>: Some spells have different effects based on the number of actions you spend to cast them. You choose whether to use the effects of the 1- or 2-action version of the spell when you use Spellstrike. A spell has to take <em>exactly</em> 1 or 2 actions; you can't use Spellstrike with a spell that takes a free action, reaction, or 3 or more actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Metamagic</strong>: You typically can't use <a href=\"/traits/107\">metamagic</a> with Spellstrike because metamagic requires the next action you take to be Cast a Spell, and Spellstrike is a combined activity that doesn't qualify.</p>\n"
