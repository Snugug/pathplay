You’re fascinated by uncovering the secrets of science and the natural world, and you’re constantly experimenting in your lab or on the go with inventive concoctions for every eventuality. You are fearless in the face of risk, hurling explosive or toxic creations at your foes. Your unique path toward greatness is lined with alchemical brews that push your mind and body to their limits.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Key Ability: Intelligence</strong>\n At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Intelligence</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier</strong>\n You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.</p>\n",
    "sidebar": "<h2 id=\"key-terms\">Key Terms</h2>\n<p>You'll see the following key terms in many alchemist abilities.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"/traits/4\">Additive</a></strong>: Feats with the additive trait allow you to spend actions to add special substances to <a href=\"/equipment/alchemical-items/alchemical-bombs\">bombs</a> or <a href=\"/equipment/alchemical-items/alchemical-elixirs\">elixirs</a>. You can add only one additive to a single alchemical item, and attempting to add another spoils the item. You can typically use actions with the additive trait only when you're creating an infused alchemical item, and some can be used only with the <a href=\"/feats/667\">Quick Alchemy</a> action. The additive trait is always followed by a level, such as additive 2. An additive adds its level to the level of the alchemical item you're modifying; the result is the new level of the mixture. The mixture's item level must be no higher than your advanced alchemy level.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"/traits/94\">Infused</a></strong>: You created an alchemical item with the infused trait using your infused reagents, and it has a limited time before it becomes inert. Any nonpermanent effects from your infused alchemical items, with the exception of afflictions such as slow-acting poisons, end when you make your daily preparations again.</p>\n",

The nature of the relationship between a witch and their patron can serve as details for character development and storytelling. When playing a witch, work with your GM to determine the nature of your patron and how much of that nature you know, both as a player and a character. There are countless ways to handle a witch's patron; the following are just a few approaches you might take.</p>\n<p>For a character who truly doesn't know their patron, you might have your GM choose your patron's theme and which lessons your witch learns, as the patron determines what powers to bestow upon you as their emissary—and these can provide clues to your patron's nature. You could instead give your GM a list of lessons you'd like for your character and let the GM choose between them, representing a negotiation between your witch and the patron. In this case, you might choose your patron's theme to indicate which aspect of the patron relates to your character, or let your GM choose the theme. If you want to be fully in control of your abilities, you can choose the lessons you most prefer and let the GM tailor the identity of your patron accordingly.</p>\n<p>Another approach is for you to craft the details of your witch's patron yourself. You can then provide those details to the GM to incorporate into a larger narrative or to provide additional flavor and roleplaying context for your character. Your character might still remain ignorant of that patron's identity, even if you as a player know it. Perhaps your character knows the nature of their patron but is cursed to never reveal it to others. You might have willingly sworn a pact to your patron but fear the repercussions should others learn of that pact. Or perhaps you and your patron are entirely forthcoming about your relationship.</p>\n<p>Every witch is different, and no story is wrong so long as it's fun and engaging for everyone involved!</p>\n",

Some feats let you affect more creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Reach</strong>: The coupled spell affects the target using the reach of the weapon or unarmed attack you make your Spellstrike with. For instance, <a href=\"/spells/283\">shocking grasp</a> would affect a creature beyond the reach of your hand if you used a weapon with <a href=\"/traits/192\">reach</a>, and <a href=\"/spells/245\">ray of frost</a> would affect only a creature in your weapon's reach, even though the spell's range is longer.</p>\n<p><strong>Ancillary Effects</strong>: Your spell still has any non-targeted effects that might affect creatures other than the target, as well as any ongoing effects starting from the moment you hit with the Strike. For example, <a href=\"/spells/3\">acid splash</a> would still deal its splash damage to creatures other than the target and <a href=\"/spells/330\">tanglefoot</a>'s circumstance penalty would last for its normal duration. The spell takes effect after the Strike deals damage; if the Strike has other special effects, the GM determines whether they happen before or after the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple Defenses</strong>: Any additional rolls after the initial spell attack still happen normally, such as the Fortitude save attempted by the target of a <a href=\"/spells/76\">disintegrate</a> spell. Similarly, a spell that allows you to attack with it again on subsequent rounds would only combine a Strike with its initial attack roll, not with any later ones.</p>\n<p><strong>Invalid or Immune Target</strong>: If the target you hit wouldn't be a valid target for the spell, the spell is still expended but doesn't affect the target. If the target is immune to your attack but not the spell, it can still be affected by the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Variable Actions</strong>: Some spells have different effects based on the number of actions you spend to cast them. You choose whether to use the effects of the 1- or 2-action version of the spell when you use Spellstrike. A spell has to take <em>exactly</em> 1 or 2 actions; you can't use Spellstrike with a spell that takes a free action, reaction, or 3 or more actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Metamagic</strong>: You typically can't use <a href=\"/traits/107\">metamagic</a> with Spellstrike because metamagic requires the next action you take to be Cast a Spell, and Spellstrike is a combined activity that doesn't qualify.</p>\n",

Your magical connection with your eidolon takes the form of a sigil on each of your bodies. As long as your eidolon is manifested, the sigil glows with light and can't be covered or disguised via any means; it will shine through clothing, appear over cloaks, and remain unaffected by obfuscating magic. This, combined with the way that the two of you clearly act in tandem, makes it readily apparent to an intelligent observer that the two of you are connected in some way, even if the person has never encountered a summoner before.

However, if you are both subject to such an effect, apply only the more severe one. For instance, if you or your eidolon were slowed 1, you would start your turn with one fewer action, but if you were both slowed 1, you would still lose only one action, rather than adding the two slowed effects together. However, if you were slowed 1 and your eidolon slowed 2, you'd have two fewer actions, because that's the more severe effect. If only one of you becomes restricted in how you can spend your actions, that restriction doesn't automatically extend to the other; for example, if your eidolon became <a href=\"/conditions/24\">immobilized</a> or <a href=\"/conditions/30\">petrified</a>, it wouldn't be able to move, but you could still use your actions to move.

If you have the reconfigure class feature, you can retrain these feats more easily.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/traits/416\">Unstable</a>: Unstable actions use experimental applications of your innovation that even you can't fully predict, and that are hazardous to your innovation (and potentially you). When you take an unstable action, attempt a DC 17 flat check immediately after applying its effects. On a failure, the innovation malfunctions in a spectacular (though harmless) fashion, such as a belch of smoke or shower of sparks, and it becomes incapable of being used for further unstable actions. On a critical failure, you also take an amount of fire damage equal to your level. As the innovation's creator, you can spend 10 minutes retuning your innovation and making adjustments to return it to functionality, at which point you can use unstable actions with that innovation again.</p>\n<p>To take an unstable action, you must be using your innovation (for example, wearing an armor innovation or wielding a weapon innovation). If you have a minion innovation, some unstable actions are taken by the minion instead of you. In these cases, only the minion can take that action, and the minion needs to have been Commanded that turn to take the action. If you critically fail the flat check, the minion takes the damage instead of you.</p>\n<p>Some actions have an Unstable Function entry, which you can use to add the unstable trait for a bigger benefit. If you're unable to use unstable actions, you can still use the action normally, but you can't use the unstable function.</p>\n",

You can apply an amp only to a psi cantrip, which is called the amped cantrip. Applying an amp to a psi cantrip costs 1 Focus Point and is part of the actions needed to Cast the Spell. The singular focus required to amp a psi cantrip means that unless otherwise noted, you can apply only one amp to a given psi cantrip, and you can't apply both an amp and a <a href=\"/traits/107\">metamagic</a> ability to a cantrip at the same time. If both an amp and the amped cantrip deal damage of the same type, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. Feats with the amp trait provide different amps you can apply to psi cantrips in place of their normal amps. If an amp has its own effect, its level is the same as the amped cantrip's.</p>\n<p><strong>Amp Heightened</strong>: Many amps have heightened entries similar to spells. Add the amp's heightened effects when you cast the cantrip at that level or higher. These are in addition to any heightened effects of the cantrip, though some adjust the cantrip's normal heightened entry (typically in the case of damage increases).</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"/traits/428\">Mindshift</a></strong>: An action with this trait can always be altered to use the raw power of your mind. When you take this action, you can choose to replace any damage it deals with mental damage, give it the mental trait, and replace any save it requires with a Will save. The action loses any traits matching damage types it no longer deals.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"/traits/429\">Psyche</a></strong>: Your psyche must be unleashed to use abilities that have the psyche trait, and they end automatically when your unleashed psyche subsides.</p>\n",

You can cast <a href=\"/spell-lists\">occult</a> spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You alter some of the standard spell components when casting spells you know from your psychic spellcasting. Instead of speaking, you substitute any verbal components with a special mental component determined by your subconscious mind class feature. This represents how you exert your mind toward your intended effect. Any of these components impart the <a href=\"/traits/32\">concentrate</a> trait to the spell you're casting. You also substitute any material components with somatic components, though these tend to be simple movements of the hand or head compared to those used by other spellcasters. Your spells still have clear and noticeable visual and auditory manifestations, as normal for a spellcaster.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a psychic, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Psychic Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is determined by your subconscious mind, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use the modifier for the ability stated in your subconscious mind.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heightening-spells\">Heightening Spells</h2>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cantrips\">Cantrips</h2>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up— this is usually equal to the highest level of psychic spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level psychic, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level psychic, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<p>As a psychic, you get the ability to improve some of your cantrips with special benefits and psi amps. Over the course of your career, your choice of conscious mind class feature gives you extra cantrips, benefits and psi amps for cantrips, and a collection of unique psi cantrips.</p>\n",

You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Your choice of conscious mind also grants you additional spells in your repertoire, starting with an additional 1st-level spell and two cantrips listed in your conscious mind, which you cast as psi cantrips (see below).</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-level spell, and so on.

However, unlike other spellcasters, you don't gain focus spells that cost Focus Points to cast.

If you've spent Focus Points only to amp psi cantrips or fuel psychic abilities since the last time you Refocused, you regain 2 Focus Points when you Refocus, up to your maximum of 2.
