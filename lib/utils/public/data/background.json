They are pleasant people and well-regarded in Nantambu, although their unshakable generosity and friendliness strike cynics as too earnest to be genuine. You know otherwise; Takulu and Niana are just as sincere as they appear. Takulu always seemed to watch you with a discerning eye, and one day he idly observed that you'd do well at the Magaambya. Talking about it further with him, Takulu agreed that he would sponsor you personally and be the one to give your intake interview. With a twinkle in his eye, he asked that you call him Teacher Ot from now on, just as all of his students do.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts.

Using a mixture of fringe science and magic, you were commissioned and trained to emulate this person in every way, and have stood in for them in countless deadly circumstances. You may or may not know the reason behind your decommissioning, but whoever discarded you didn't finish you off. Now, the world is yours to explore—but “you” may have a bold or brutish reputation, or the individual you were duplicating may be long dead. Regardless of the fate of this individual, your way of life has changed drastically.</p>\n<p>You and the GM can work out how to incorporate your previous life into your story. The GM can keep this knowledge hidden even from you, or you or another character know what happened. You and the GM can also leave the information unspecified and fill it in later.</p>\n<p>You gain three free ability boosts. You choose two, and the GM chooses one based on the attributes of the character you were built to duplicate.</p>\n",

The shame is that you don't even know what it is, exactly, that you saw.</p>\n<p>After moving to Alkenstar, you swiftly fell in love with the City of Smog, but you found it difficult to get a foothold in the fast-paced metropolis. Luckily, a chance invitation promised good work for someone with your unique social talents. You went to an inconspicuous chamber in a humble tower somewhere in the Capital District. There, you met some clearly powerful, clearly corrupt members of the Alkenstar elite. Among the faces you recognized were the notorious mogul Ambrost Mugland and the steely-eyed shieldmarshal Anjelique Loveless. Before you were asked to leave, you made quite an impression—but not a good one.</p>\n<p>Not only did you not make the cut for whatever kinds of jobs were on offer that day, but you soon discovered that you couldn't get a room at any inn in the city, and there were wanted posters with your name on them plastered all over town. Friends and families turned their backs on you, afraid to get involved. Clearly, someone at that meeting—Mugland, maybe, or perhaps Loveless— believed you were a liability, and they had you excised from Alkenstar society. All you want is to be able to walk the streets without fearing for your life, and there's only one way to make that happen: find the villains responsible for your predicament and get them to undo the curse now attached to your name.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts.

    "description": "<p><a href=\"/traits/137\">Rare</a>\n<strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/197\">Stolen Fate Player's Guide</a> pg. 12</p>\n<p>Destiny has always intrigued you. Maybe you grew up in a family where fortune-telling and divinations were a day-to-day part of life, or perhaps you had your fortune told as a young adult and the results were so shockingly accurate that you became a believer. The mysteries of what might lie in store for us all have long intrigued you, and you're always eager to debate whether or not we have free will or if destiny is predetermined—be it for one side or the other. You may see the failure of prophecy that began with the onset of the Age of Lost Omens as a dire indication of some sort of horrible cosmic mistake. Conversely, you could view this age as new era of freedom where reality is finally admitting that each person is free to determine their own path to the future. You still own a small token from your childhood that you view as a lucky charm, but whatever your beliefs are today, many of your fortunes have foretold that great things lie in store for you in the future, and you can't wait to find out what they might be!</p>\n<p>This background is associated with the suit of Stars.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Wisdom</strong>, and one is a free ability boost.</p>\n<p>You gain the <a href=\"/feats/2141\">Pilgrim's Token</a> skill feat (this token need not be from a faith and could simply be a good luck charm) and are trained in the <a href=\"/skills/8\">Fortune-Telling Lore</a> skill. You also gain the following free action.</p>\n<p><strong>A Quick Glimpse Beyond</strong>  (<a href=\"/traits/76\">fortune</a>) <strong>Trigger</strong> You attempt a <a href=\"/traits/142\">secret</a> check; <strong>Frequency</strong> once per day; <strong>Effect</strong> You can roll the secret check yourself rather than have the GM roll it. As you roll, draw a harrow card. If the card drawn is from the suit of Stars, the next secret check you make during the next 24 hours can also be rolled by you. Each time you roll your own additional secret check in this way, draw a new harrow card, and each time you draw a card from the suit of Stars, your next secret check in the next 24 hours can also be rolled by you. If you ever critically fail a secret check that you roll yourself as a result of this ability, fate turns away from you, and your Pilgrim's Token no longer functions until the next time you make your daily preparations.</p>\n",
