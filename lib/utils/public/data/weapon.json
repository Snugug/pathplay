As an action, you can load a single lesser alchemical bomb into the bracket; this bomb must be one that deals energy damage (such as an <a href=\"/equipment/74\">acid flask</a>, <a href=\"/equipment/75\">alchemist’s fire</a>, <a href=\"/equipment/76\">bottled lightning</a>, <a href=\"/equipment/77\">frost vial</a>, or <a href=\"/equipment/79\">thunderstone</a>). The next three attacks made with the crossbow deal 1d6 damage of the bomb’s damage type in addition to the crossbow’s normal damage. If the second and third attacks are not all made within 1 minute of the first attack, the bomb’s energy is wasted. These attacks never deal splash damage or other special effects of the bomb and are not modified by any abilities that add to or modify a bomb’s effect. The addition of the bracket serves to unbalance the weapon, reducing its range to 30 feet. It otherwise functions as a crossbow (when determining damage, reload, and so on). Creatures use their crossbow proficiency when using the alchemical crossbow. The alchemical crossbow costs 25 gp.</p>\n<h2 id=\"critical-specialization-effects\">Critical Specialization Effects</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/1\">Core Rulebook</a> pg. 283</p>\n<p>Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success.

Once extended to its full length (usually around 2 feet), the baton locks into shape until the wielder uses an Interact action to collapse it—a collapsed nightstick is 8 inches long, making it easily concealed. Lighter and more maneuverable than an ordinary club or truncheon, nightsticks are designed to subdue foes without causing permanent injury. A nightstick is an uncommon simple melee weapon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"critical-specialization-effects\">Critical Specialization Effects</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/1\">Core Rulebook</a> pg. 283</p>\n<p>Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success.

The frame's set of mechanical linkages connected at various hinges allow movements to propagate across the frame based on reshaping parallelograms, further controlled by a crossbar grasped in your hand. A pantograph gauntlet is driven by your own motion and mirrors your arm's movements—a punch thrown with your fist moves the pantograph, extending the weight out at a rapid speed to land blows up to 10 feet away. In some regions, such as Alkenstar and Ustalav, pantograph gauntlets are occasionally constructed entirely of metal and fashioned in the likeness of oversized arms, incorporating a complex system of gears or a miniature steam engine in place of the simpler pantograph mechanism.</p>\n<h2 id=\"critical-specialization-effects\">Critical Specialization Effects</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/1\">Core Rulebook</a> pg. 283</p>\n<p>Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success.

A dwarven scattergun fires a large paper cartridge stuffed with black powder and knuckle-sized lumps of metal, creating a devastating burst so destructive that a foolish dwarf might find themself catching painful ricochets when firing at a too-close target. Some scatterguns are crafted with a clockwork firing tray that can quickly sort and load black powder and shot without needing a prepackaged cartridge, though this is largely an aesthetic feature with no real mechanical benefit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"critical-specialization-effects\">Critical Specialization Effects</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/1\">Core Rulebook</a> pg. 283</p>\n<p>Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success.
