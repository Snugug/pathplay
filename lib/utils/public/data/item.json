The elixir can’t change your form into that of a specific person. After the form takes hold, you retain it for the next 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>Drinking this elixir counts as setting up a disguise to Impersonate.

    "description": "<p>An alchemist with the <a href=\"/feats/127\">Craft Philosopher's Stone</a> feat can create a philosopher's stone once per month by spending 1 batch of infused reagents during their daily preparations using the advanced alchemy class feature. This is the only way to create a philosopher's stone.</p>\n<p>At a glance, a philosopher's stone appears to be an ordinary, sooty piece of natural rock. Breaking the rock open with a <a href=\"/actions/34\">Force Open</a> action (DC 35) reveals a cavity at the stone's heart. The cavity is lined with a rare type of quicksilver that can transmute base metals into precious metals or create an <a href=\"/equipment/92\">elixir of rejuvenation</a>.</p>\n<p>To use the quicksilver, you must be legendary in <a href=\"/skills/4\">Crafting</a> and have the <a href=\"/feats/752\">Alchemical Crafting</a> feat. You can then use the stone's quicksilver for one of two effects:</p>\n<p>- \nYou can apply the stone's quicksilver to an infused <a href=\"/equipment/91\">true elixir of life</a> using an Interact action. This turns the elixir into an infused <a href=\"/equipment/92\">elixir of rejuvenation</a> instantaneously. This doesn't require any crafting time or additional materials.</p>\n<p>- \nYou can spend up to a month of downtime applying the quicksilver either to iron to create silver or to lead to create gold. Treat this as a 20th-level task to <a href=\"/actions/23\">Earn Income</a> using Crafting, except that you create 500 gp worth of your chosen metal per day on a success or 750 gp worth per day on a critical success.</p>\n"

The recipient must be someone you have met, and the location must be somewhere you have visited. After receiving the message, the bird flies off to deliver it, traveling at 30 miles per hour and then searching for the target in the location you provided. If the bird finds the target, it moves adjacent to them, your words emanate from the bird, and the bird then flies off and vanishes.

This chest can hold up to 10 Bulk worth of items. Once the chest is closed, it transforms again—this time into a key—taking all of the stored items with it. You can activate this key by spending an Interact action to turn it in an imaginary lock, which causes it to transform back into a chest with all of the items still inside. Once it has turned into a chest a second time, it forever remains a wooden chest.</p>\n<h2 id=\"feather-token-fanitem-4\">Feather Token (Fan)Item 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/1\">Core Rulebook</a> pg. 570</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 15 gp</p>\n<p>Activating this feather requires you to fan it in a given direction. If this direction is toward the sail of a vessel, the feather flutters up toward the sail and fans continuously, filling the sail with air and granting the vessel a +10-foot circumstance bonus to its Speed for 8 hours. If fanned in any other direction, it instead produces a single casting of <a href=\"/spells/143\">gust of wind</a> (DC 20).</p>\n<h2 id=\"feather-token-holly-bushitem-2\">Feather Token (Holly Bush)Item 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/1\">Core Rulebook</a> pg. 570</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 6 gp</p>\n<p>When this feather is activated, it immediately transforms into a living holly bush, filling a single square. This bush can provide standard cover. In addition, the bush has 2d4 bright-red berries. While holly berries are usually poisonous, these berries are infused with beneficial magic. You can pick and eat a berry as an Interact action to recover 1 Hit Point. Once plucked from the bush, a berry becomes non-magical after a few seconds, so it doesn’t heal you if you don’t eat it within the span of your Interact action.</p>\n<p>If activated on soil, the plant continues to grow and thrive (although it doesn’t produce any more healing berries).

One round after being activated, the balloon rises up into the air at a speed of 20 feet per round.

    "description": "<p>The hide and scales of a dragon can be used to Craft any item normally made of ordinary leather or hide. Dragonhide varies in color from blue to glittering gold, depending on the dragon it came from. Due to the scales’ resiliency, it can also be used to Craft armor usually made out of metal plates (such as a breastplate, half plate, and full plate), allowing such armor to be made without metal. Dragonhide objects are immune to one damage type, depending on the type of dragon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dragonhide-resistance\">Dragonhide Resistance</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Dragon Type</th>\n<th>Resistance</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Black or copper</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Acid</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blue or bronze</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Electricity</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brass, gold, or red</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fire</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Green</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Poison</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Silver or white</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cold</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h2 id=\"dragonhide-items\">Dragonhide Items</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Dragonhide Items</th>\n<th>Hardness</th>\n<th>HP</th>\n<th>BT</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Thin Items</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Standard-grade</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>High-grade</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>32</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Items</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Standard-grade</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>28</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>High-grade</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>44</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>22</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"material-uses\">Material Uses</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/equipment/142\">Dragonhide Armor</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/equipment/313\">Dragonhide Shield</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"dragonhide-object-standard-gradeitem-8\">Dragonhide Object (Standard-Grade)Item 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/1\">Core Rulebook</a> pg. 579</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 350 gp (per Bulk)</p>\n<h2 id=\"dragonhide-object-high-gradeitem-16\">Dragonhide Object (High-Grade)Item 16</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/1\">Core Rulebook</a> pg. 579</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 6,000 gp (per Bulk)</p>\n"

    "description": "<p>Mithral is renowned for its lightness, durability, and effectiveness against a range of creatures including devils and lycanthropes. It has the same sheen as silver but a slightly lighter hue. Mithral weapons and armor are treated as if they were silver for the purpose of damaging creatures with weakness to silver. A metal item made of mithral is lighter than one made of iron or steel: the item’s Bulk is reduced by 1 (reduced to light Bulk if its normal Bulk is 1, with no effect on an item that normally has light Bulk). The Price of an item made of this material is based on the item’s normal Bulk, not its reduced Bulk for being made of mithral, but reduce the Bulk before making any further Bulk adjustments for the size of the item.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mithral-items\">Mithral Items</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Mithral

When wielding the staff, you can break it using an Interact action. This releases a 30-foot‑burst magical explosion centered on the staff. This deals 2d10 force damage per charge remaining in the staff (DC 40 basic Reflex save), You automatically critically fail your save. The explosion continues to echo beyond the initial blast zone, dealing half as much damage to creatures beyond 30 feet but within a 60-foot burst. A creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage dies instantly; this is a death effect.\nFailed to load action-197</h2>\n<p><strong>Cantrip</strong> <a href=\"/spells/66\">detect magic</a>, <a href=\"/spells/171\">light</a>, <a href=\"/spells/177\">mage hand</a>, <a href=\"/spells/334\">telekinetic projectile</a></p>\n<p>- \n<strong>1st</strong> <a href=\"/spells/174\">lock</a></p>\n<p>- \n<strong>2nd</strong> <a href=\"/spells/102\">enlarge</a>, <a href=\"/spells/136\">glitterdust</a>, <a href=\"/spells/164\">invisibility</a>, <a href=\"/spells/168\">knock</a>, <a href=\"/spells/333\">telekinetic maneuver</a>, <a href=\"/spells/374\">web</a></p>\n<p>- \n<strong>3rd</strong> <a href=\"/spells/78\">dispel magic</a>, <a href=\"/spells/119\">fireball</a>, <a href=\"/spells/172\">lightning bolt</a></p>\n<p>- \n<strong>4th</strong> <em>invisibility</em>, <em>enlarge</em>, <em>fireball</em>, <a href=\"/spells/362\">wall of fire</a>, <em>web</em></p>\n<p>- \n<strong>5th</strong> <a href=\"/spells/47\">cone of cold</a>, <a href=\"/spells/216\">passwall</a>, <a href=\"/spells/332\">telekinetic haul</a></p>\n<p>- \n<strong>6th</strong> <a href=\"/spells/76\">disintegrate</a>, <em>dispel magic</em>, <em>fireball</em>, <em>lightning bolt</em></p>\n<p>- \n<strong>7th</strong> <em>cone of cold</em>, <em>passwall</em>, <a href=\"/spells/222\">plane shift</a>, <em>wall of fire</em></p>\n<p>- \n<strong>8th</strong> <em>fireball</em>, <a href=\"/spells/176\">mage armor</a></p>\n<p>- \n<strong>9th</strong> <em>dispel magic</em>, <a href=\"/spells/191\">meteor swarm</a>, <a href=\"/spells/319\">summon dragon</a></p>\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> Supply one casting of all listed levels of all listed spells.</p>\n"

Any fundamental runes on the weapon in the hand wearing the iron ring are suppressed.</p>\n<p>The replication functions only if you wear both rings, and it ends as soon as you cease wielding a melee weapon in one of your hands.

The first compartment is lined in blue satin and contains an extradimensional space equivalent to a <a href=\"/equipment/249\">type II bag of holding</a>.</p>\n<p>The second compartment has no lining. You can pull forth cookware and cooking utensils from it. Once they have been used to prepare a meal, the items transform into plates and silverware, and they evaporate once the meal has been eaten, taking any leftovers with them. The cookware reappears cleaned in the compartment 1 hour later. The compartment provides only kitchenware, not any food.</p>\n<p>The third compartment is lined with plush purple velvet and contains berry tarts wrapped in parchment paper. A creature can unwrap and eat one tart with an Interact action to regain 2d8+4 Hit Points. The knapsack produces four tarts per day, which appear at breakfast time. Any tarts not eaten by the end of the day evaporate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"knapsack-of-halflingkinditem-9\">Knapsack of HalflingkindItem 9</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/1\">Core Rulebook</a> pg. 612</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 675 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Bulk</strong> L</p>\n<h2 id=\"knapsack-of-halflingkind-greateritem-13\">Knapsack of Halflingkind (Greater)Item 13</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/1\">Core Rulebook</a> pg. 612</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 2,850 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Bulk</strong> L</p>\n<p>The berry tarts each restore 4d8+8 Hit Points, and the bag has two additional compartments, each of which can be Activated with an Interact action.</p>\n<p>The fourth compartment is lined in golden velvet. Once per day, you can draw a lucky magic sling bullet from this compartment. If you attack with this sling bullet, you roll twice and use the better result on your attack roll and your damage roll. This is a fortune effect. The stone becomes non-magical if not hurled by the end of your turn. Once activated, this compartment stitches itself shut until the next day.</p>\n<p>The bag’s fifth compartment is lined in black wool. Once per day, you can unfold this compartment into a 5-foot-diameter portal on the ground. The first person to Step into the portal from an adjacent square is teleported away. This has the same effect as an 5th-level <a href=\"/spells/69\">dimension door</a> spell, except the affected creature takes the knapsack with them. When the portal is used, or at the start of your next turn if it hasn’t been used, the compartment closes automatically and can’t be unfolded until the next day.</p>\n"

You invest a <em>wayfinder</em> and the <em>aeon stone</em> within it simultaneously, and they count as only one item toward your investiture limit. An invested <em>aeon stone</em> slotted in a <em>wayfinder</em> also grants its resonant power.</p>\n<p>If you have more than one <em>wayfinder</em> with an invested <em>aeon stone</em> on your person at a given time, destructive interference from their resonance prevents you from gaining benefits from any of them.

By placing an object of light Bulk onto the dish, you can determine its value in gold pieces in the market in which the scale was made (most of these scales are made in Katapesh or Absalom), based on its material composition and artisanship. For example, after placing a gemstone on the dish, the scale will indicate the fairest (average, in most cases) price you can expect to fetch in the market to which the scale is calibrated, but the scale wouldn’t detect the gemstone’s historical significance or any magical properties. <em>Abadar’s flawless scale</em> can be calibrated to a different market by performing a 1-hour ritual in the proximity of that market.</p>\n"

    "description": "<p>Legends claim that some long-forgotten god stole the original bundle of <em>shots of the First Vault</em> from <a href=\"/deities/1\">Abadar’s</a> repository. Since then, individual pieces have turned up throughout the multiverse. When you pick up a <em>shot of the First Vault</em>, it immediately reshapes itself to function with any ranged weapon and establishes you as its owner until another creature picks it up. As its owner, you can use the shot’s single-action activation after shooting it.</p>\n<p>Instead of rolling weapon damage dice, a <em>shot of the First Vault</em> deals 25 damage plus any bonuses or additional damage as if 25 were the result of the weapon’s damage dice; the damage type matches that normally dealt by the weapon. Upon damaging a creature, the <em>shot of the First Vault</em> shatters, and the fragments ricochet to hit any other enemies within 30 feet, making attack rolls with the same attack bonus. The shattered fragments remain lodged in the creatures they damage; the creatures are <a href=\"/conditions/3\">clumsy 2</a> while the fragments remain in place. A total of 3 actions, which have the <a href=\"/traits/104\">manipulate</a> trait, are required to remove the fragments from yourself or an adjacent creature; alternatively, a single action and a successful DC 30 <a href=\"/skills/9\">Medicine</a> check can be used. A critical failure on this Medicine check deals 10 <a href=\"/conditions/29\">persistent bleed damage</a> to the creature with the embedded fragment.\nFailed to load action-406Failed to load action-407\n<strong>Destruction</strong> If 10 <em>shots of the First Vault</em> are all fired at the same group of <a href=\"/monsters/338\">keketar</a> or izfiitar <a href=\"/monster-families/82\">proteans</a> within 1 minute of each other, each shot was a hit, and the shots are then recalled, the shots collide as they attempt to re-form and crumble to dust.</p>\n"

Characters in search of sovereign steel weapons and armor will almost assuredly have to travel to Starfall to procure gear made from this rare alloy. While some believe it possible to craft shields of sovereign steel as well, in one of his fits, Kevoth-Kul yelled that he had no use for them and banned anyone from making such a thing. So far, his smiths have been too afraid to confirm whether or not it was a joke. All sovereign steel items (including weapon and armor below) have a +4 circumstance bonus on saves against magic that the item makes, and grant their bonus to saves the owner makes specifically to protect the item from magic (such as against the <a href=\"/spells/711\">rusting grasp</a> spell).</p>\n<h2 id=\"soverign-steel-items\">Soverign Steel Items</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Soverign

The first, a delicate brush and a jar of extremely fine dust, is used to reveal fingerprints left behind by most humanoid creatures. The dust sticks to the natural oils left behind on smooth surfaces. When you use the kit to determine whether or not creatures left behind a fingerprint at a crime scene, the GM rolls a <a href=\"/traits/142\">secret</a> <a href=\"/skills/17\">Thievery</a> check against the Thievery DC of every creature capable of leaving prints that has interacted with the scene. On a success, you locate a clear print from that creature and carefully transfer it to a special sheet of sticky paper. (Note that fingerprints can last for days, and prints collected in this manner often include those of victims, witnesses, and unrelated passersby.) At the GM's discretion, the print-leaving creature might get a bonus to its Thievery DC for taking special precautions. In other cases, finding a print might be impossible (such as if the creature was wearing gloves or if the location has been significantly compromised).</p>\n<p>The second part of the kit is a small sheaf of paper and a pad soaked in ink. By forcing a humanoid creature with fingerprints to roll a finger across the pad and then press it to the paper, you can obtain an image of the unique whorls in that creature's fingerprints. These can then be compared to any prints found at a crime scene. Successfully determining whether or not two prints match requires a DC 15 Perception check—the GM should roll this check secretly as well, since a failed check may result in false information.</p>\n"

An item repaired by quickpatch glue regains the broken condition after it takes damage or 1 hour passes (whichever comes first). In order to apply a new vial of quickpatch glue to or repair the item, the item's holder must first remove the glue residue, a process that requires 10 minutes of effort and a set of <a href=\"/equipment/2\">alchemist's tools</a>.</p>\n"

    "description": "<p>A fixer is a guide who knows the inner workings of life in a given location. The right fixer can help you navigate the complicated alleyways of a new city or the tangled social expectations of the local populace. Every fixer has knowledge about a specific location, such as a settlement like Katapesh, a geographical region like the Verduran Forest, or a notable establishment like the Grand Lodge. If you plan to hire a fixer, you must do so for the specific location for which you need a guide, though the GM can decide that a given fixer may be able to provide assistance with a closely related location, such as a fixer for the Isle of Kortos being able to provide some guidance for the town of Diobel.</p>\n<p>There are two varieties of fixers: informants and counselors. Informants help provide basic information on a location, such as how to navigate a city, the type of animals native to a region, or the type of clothing worn by specific members of a local thieves' guild. An informant automatically <a href=\"/actions/75\">Aids</a> you on attempts to <a href=\"/actions/49\">Gather Information</a> and <a href=\"/actions/26\">Recall Knowledge</a> about your specific location, granting you a +1 circumstance bonus to such checks. An expert informant critically succeeds at Aiding you, granting a +2 circumstance bonus.</p>\n<p>A counselor is specialized in social matters. They can help you learn proper etiquette, introduce you to important or useful people, and generally help navigate social circles. A counselor automatically Aids you on attempts to <a href=\"/actions/46\">Impersonate</a>, <a href=\"/actions/47\">Lie</a>, <a href=\"/actions/50\">Make an Impression</a>, and <a href=\"/actions/51\">Request</a> when speaking with individuals within the location of the counselor's expertise. An expert counselor critically succeeds at Aiding you, granting a +2 circumstance bonus.</p>\n<p>The GM is the final arbiter in deciding whether or a not a fixer for a given location is available. A fixer's rate may also change depending on the location or the nature of guidance required. For example, a fixer might lower their rate for simple guidance, such as locating the best Qadiran cuisine in Absalom, or increase their rate when dealing with dangerous information or individuals, such as helping navigate a sewer inhabited by dangerous monsters. Pathfinders are typically able to hire a fixer without issue, but must do so through contacts at a local lodge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fixer-basic-informantitem-0\">Fixer (Basic Informant)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/50\">PFS Guide</a> pg. 116</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 5 sp (per hour)</p>\n<h2 id=\"fixer-expert-informantitem-0\">Fixer (Expert Informant)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/50\">PFS Guide</a> pg. 116</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 1 gp (per hour)</p>\n<h2 id=\"fixer-basic-counceloritem-0\">Fixer (Basic Councelor)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/50\">PFS Guide</a> pg. 116</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 1 gp (per hour)</p>\n<h2 id=\"fixer-expert-counceloritem-0\">Fixer (Expert Councelor)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/50\">PFS Guide</a> pg. 116</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 2 gp (per hour)</p>\n"

    "description": "<p>In cities all around the world you can find temples, city archives, and organizations like the Pathfinder Society where scholars and librarians can be hired to do research for you or aid you in your own research. Each researcher specializes in a particular subject such as flora native to the Mwangi Expanse, leaders of the First Mendevian Crusade, or Absalom shipping routes. If you plan to hire a researcher, you must hire one for the appropriate subject. The GM can decide that an appropriate researcher is unavailable in a given location, requiring you to look elsewhere for a researcher.</p>\n<p>A researcher can be hired to do independent research or as a research assistant. Regardless of what they're hired for, you must specify the level of researcher you're hiring, which is typically not higher than the level of the settlement in which they are hired. When contracting independent research, you hire the researcher to study a subject on your behalf and report the findings to you upon completion. An independent researcher can provide information on subjects up to their level +4, though more difficult tasks take much longer to research. Once the research is done, the researcher presents the relevant findings for the subject as determined by the GM, which is typically the critical success of <a href=\"/actions/26\">Recall Knowledge</a>. The level of the subject determines how long the independent research takes. A researcher can provide information on a subject of their level after 1 week. The researcher needs an additional week for every additional level of the subject above their own. For example, a level 6 independent researcher can provide pertinent information on subjects of up to 10th level, but would need 5 weeks to do so. A researcher needs less time when researching subjects of a lower level. A subject 1 level lower requires 5 days, a subject 2 levels lower requires only 3 days, and a researcher only needs 1 day for a subject 3 levels lower. A subject 4 or more levels lower takes less than 1 day and typically not more than 12 hours, as the GM dictates.</p>\n<p>When hired as a research assistant, a researcher provides a bonus to checks during the <a href=\"/rules/1205\">research subsystem</a>. The research assistant automatically <a href=\"/actions/75\">Aids</a> a single PC with a single skill check rolled as part of researching. If the research assistant is at least 4 levels higher than the level of the library, the Aid is a critical success instead, possibly granting a higher bonus based on the research assistant's proficiency. A research assistant can never help out with a library that's more than 4 levels higher than their own level.</p>\n<p>The GM ultimately decides if a researcher is available for a given subject. Particularly obscure subjects may be outside of the capabilities of a hired researcher and are best reserved as something that the PCs must research themselves. Pathfinders typically employ fellow Pathfinders for additional research and must do so by working with a local lodge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"researcher-level-1-traineditem-0\">Researcher (Level 1; trained)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/50\">PFS Guide</a> pg. 116</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 4 gp (per day)</p>\n<h2 id=\"researcher-level-2item-0\">Researcher (Level 2)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/50\">PFS Guide</a> pg. 116</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 6 gp (per day)</p>\n<h2 id=\"researcher-level-3-expertitem-0\">Researcher (Level 3; expert)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/50\">PFS Guide</a> pg. 116</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 10 gp (per day)</p>\n<h2 id=\"researcher-level-4item-0\">Researcher (Level 4)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/50\">PFS Guide</a> pg. 116</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 14 gp (per day)</p>\n<h2 id=\"researcher-level-5item-0\">Researcher (Level 5)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/50\">PFS Guide</a> pg. 116</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 20 gp (per day)</p>\n<h2 id=\"researcher-level-6item-0\">Researcher (Level 6)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/50\">PFS Guide</a> pg. 116</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 40 gp (per day)</p>\n<h2 id=\"researcher-level-7-masteritem-0\">Researcher (Level 7; master)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/50\">PFS Guide</a> pg. 116</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 50 gp (per day)</p>\n"

If there was already a soul fragment in the mask when this happens, you roll a Will save against the Will DC of the person who left the previous fragment.

While under the effects of the tonic, you can easily consume even the spiciest of foods without trouble.\nFailed to load action-682</p>\n"

Once she finished its physical construction, the sorcerer Belcorra Haruvex used this spot as a source of power to infuse the walls, floors, and ceilings of each of <em>Gauntlight's</em> levels with eldritch power. The lens at the apex of the lighthouse would have, in time, been able to focus this lingering eldritch energy into a powerful beam, but Belcorra's plans were cut short before she could replace the mundane lenses with dangerous magical ones.</p>\n<p>As an artifact, <em>Gauntlight</em> can't be damaged by normal means. Its walls are impenetrable and impervious to any attempt to breach them by anybody except for followers of Nhimbaloth. They block effects that allow temporary passage, such as <a href=\"/spells/216\">passwall</a>, and also create a barrier against dimensional travel. The walls attempt to <a href=\"/rules/371\">counteract</a> <a href=\"/traits/156\">teleportation</a> effects and planar travel into or out of areas within <em>Gauntlight</em> and efforts to summon creatures into the area (using a +37 counteract modifier); this effect does not stop a summoned creature from departing when the summoning ends.</p>\n<p>In <em>Gauntlight's</em> current state of diminished functionality, it can be activated only in the two ways below. By swapping in a series of magical lighthouse lenses that focus Nhimbaloth's baleful gaze—lenses so powerful that even Belcorra takes special care with them—the artifact gains significantly greater power, including the ability to reach all the way to Absalom and to activate its effects every minute. These lenses are described in “Eyes of Empty Death,” the third adventure in the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path.</p>\n<p>To activate <em>Gauntlight</em>, a creature must be in the deepest portion of the artifact (this chamber is in the Temple level and is presented in “Eyes of Empty Death”). From this point, a creature can observe the world outside remotely through <em>Gauntlight's</em> lens, including any area <em>Gauntlight's</em> beam can reach.\nFailed to load action-692Failed to load action-693\n<strong>Destruction</strong> If Belcorra's ghost is permanently destroyed, <em>Gauntlight</em> loses all of its magical properties and collapses in on itself all the way down to its base, leaving an incredibly deep pit in the Fogfen.</p>\n"

    "description": "<p>This hefty tome was compiled centuries ago by an anonymous author who sought to collect all parables, myths, stories, and encounters with the Outer Goddess <a href=\"/deities/163\">Nhimbaloth</a>. According to the introduction, the author's original intent was to create a work that foes of the Empty Death could use to fight against her influence, but as one reads through the book, it becomes apparent that the opposite effect has been achieved—by compiling these stories, the author inadvertently generated a work that made it easier for Nhimbaloth to influence the world. Those who venerate the Empty Death seek copies of this book to use as a guide and religious text, while those who don't know better and peruse the book as though it were merely an anthology of stories find themselves unwittingly falling prey to Nhimbaloth's cult or agents of the entity herself. Those who study from <em>The Whispering Reeds</em> for too long are often cursed to rise as <a href=\"/monster-families/51\">ghosts</a> after death— though their existence never lasts for long, as they are inevitably consumed by Nhimbaloth.</p>\n<p>If a character understands the dangers of this book, however, moderated use can stall or even prevent such a fate from befalling them. If a character takes special care, they can even potentially use <em>The Whispering Reeds</em> for its original purpose—as a weapon against the cult of Nhimbaloth. Using the text too often or leveraging some of its more powerful effects, however, causes the user to feel an ominous chill. In these cases, the user is exposed to the tome's curse, Empty Death (see below).</p>\n<p>The anonymous compiler wanted to produce an enormous print run of The Whispering Reeds, but after the initial run they realized the danger and scuttled those plans, instead attempting to destroy those copies already created. This crusade caught the attention of Nhimbaloth's cult, who swiftly assassinated the compiler. Fewer than two dozen copies of this rare tome are believed to still exist. The book's sinister nature causes all attempts to transcribe it to fail, resulting in bodies of gibberish, nonsense text.</p>\n<p><em>The Whispering Reeds</em> provides several abilities, but you can't activate any of them while you are <a href=\"/conditions/37\">stupefied</a> unless you are a follower of Nhimbaloth.\nFailed to load action-696Failed to load action-697Failed to load action-698Failed to load action-699\n<strong>Empty Death</strong> (<a href=\"/traits/38\">curse</a>, <a href=\"/traits/117\">necromancy</a>, <a href=\"/traits/120\">occult</a>) <strong>Saving Throw</strong> DC 27 Will; <strong>Effect</strong> If you activate <em>The Whispering Reeds</em> and are not a worshipper of Nhimbaloth, you become stupefied 2 for 24 hours as your thoughts fill with paranoia that something is watching you from the other side of death. If you die while affected by the Empty Death, you immediately become a chaotic evil ghost. Every 7 days that pass after you become a ghost, you must succeed at a DC 2 flat check— failure indicates that you are consumed by Nhimbaloth. A creature whose ghost is consumed in this way does not travel to the River of Souls and is utterly annihilated; this creature can only be restored to life via a 10th-level spell effect or ritual like <a href=\"/spells/377\">wish</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> Copies of <em>The Whispering Reeds</em> have no special protections and can be destroyed like any regular book, but doing so exposes the one who destroyed the book to the Empty Death.</p>\n"

They belong to a larger set of lenses created to manipulate or even bind the Empty Death; most of the other lenses are long lost and likely destroyed. The Haruvex family came into possession of four of the lenses, and they knew that bringing them together focused Nhimbaloth's attention in unprecedented and dangerous ways. Belcorra brought all four lenses to the Abomination Vaults with her, intending to install them in Gauntlight for her ultimate revenge upon Absalom. She also created a special receptacle called the <a href=\"/equipment/943\">Fulcrum Lattice</a> to hold the lenses so that their power could be focused together. She realized the danger of keeping the <em>fulcrum lenses</em> too close together until the right time and spread them out among loyal groups in the Abomination Vaults' lowest levels for safekeeping.</p>\n<p>Belcorra keeps only the most powerful lens, the <em>Ebon Fulcrum Lens</em>, with her—indeed, as a ghost, it's the only one she can carry. If the heroes can bring the other three lenses to bear against Belcorra, they can draw Nhimbaloth's dread glare to the sorcerer. Despite her loyalty, Belcorra can't hope to keep her spirit intact when Nhimbaloth gazes directly upon it.</p>\n<p>The <em>fulcrum lenses</em> are more than mere receptacles of Nhimbaloth's essence.

Comprised of four thematic suits of 13 cards each, as well as two wildcards, the <em>deck of mischief</em> is a favorite of scoundrels who prefer not to leave their games to chance—or to at least nudge the odds in their favor. If you know how to activate the deck, you can illusorily transform the ace and face cards into other cards in the deck.</p>\n<p>The deck is true to its name and less likely to comply with your wishes if not well cared for. While surprisingly resistant to the elements, a waterlogged, dirty, or battered deck may not function as desired, giving you incorrect information about which cards are still in the deck or failing to hold the illusion at a critical moment. If a deck becomes incomplete due to damaged or missing cards, it rapidly loses its deceptive capabilities and might even purposefully sabotage you.\nFailed to load action-843</p>\n"

Once activated, the cart moves forward at a speed of 30 feet per round on your turn for up to 1 minute. If it strikes an obstruction, it attempts to continue its movement, pushing with an <a href=\"/skills/3\">Athletics</a> bonus of +5, once per round. The wind-up cart has AC 15, Hardness 2, 24 Hit Points, and a Break Threshold of 12. After its 1-minute duration completes, the cart collapses back into scrap.</p>\n"

It takes the shape of a glass cube 50 feet wide and seven feet high filled with sea water, flanked by two much smaller water tanks. A sparse brass frame around the device keeps the tanks themselves from touching the ground and serves as a mounting point for a pair of electrical coils on the top, which are enclosed within separate glass tubes. Six electric eels swim within the central tank, while a number of animals belonging to species considered to be the eels' natural prey swim in the smaller feeding tanks. With the simple pull of a lever attached to either smaller tank, one of the prey animals is released into the eel tank. Within seconds, the eels converge on the hapless animal, using their electrical charges to stun their victims. When this happens, the salty seawater conducts the electrical energy into transfer coils hidden within the brass frame, which send the energy to the top-mounted electrical coils. The end result produces enough light to fully illuminate a room as though it were midday.</p>\n<p>This device is an expression of a recent trend among certain Avistani nobles to blend form and function in their manors' interior decorations. In such circles, ostentatious decorations that serve no functional purpose are derided as “tacky” and “unrefined.” If a noble in such company wishes not to be ridiculed, they must be sure that each decoration adds something to the room beyond the aesthetic. The aquarium lamp is the latest tool in this social arms race, and it's already proven popular with its target market.</p>\n<p>When active, the aquarium lamp produces bright light in a 60-foot radius (and dim light for the next 60 feet). Each activation provides enough energy for 10 minutes of use, and the two feeding tanks combined carry enough prey animals for 50 activations before needing to be refilled, though electric eels usually need feeding only once per day, and won't go after the prey if they're all full. While electric eels are not aggressive to their aquarium keepers and will gradually learn to associate them with food, they can engage in violent social behavior, especially when they are young. This behavior leads to small fights involving tail slapping, biting, and discharged electricity, the last of which causes the lamp to illuminate without hitting the lever to release prey. The electric eels live around 15 years if kept well-fed.</p>\n"

Once packing instructions have been input, you can load a crate onto the clockwork box packer, and it begins its task. Once the box is stacked, the clockwork box packer closes the box, if necessary, then ties a ribbon or cord around it from a supply loaded into the clockwork box packer in advance. Once the package is secure, the clockwork box packer stacks it and then swivels back into position, ready to accept another box. In this way, the clockwork device can finish within minutes a packing job that might take humanoid workers an hour.</p>\n"

    "description": "<p>Sometimes, just disguising one's face just isn't convincing enough. Clockwork disguises were invented to supplement regular disguise kits, which are used all across Golarion. For example, if a spy wants to infiltrate a military camp, they must be wearing the same type of armor as the soldiers stationed there—or else have a very good explanation for their commander as to why they're out of proper uniform! The clockwork disguise is intended to help avoid such awkward, potentially fatal confrontations.</p>\n<p>The clockwork disguise looks like a harness connected to hundreds of small metal plates that cover the user's torso and arms. Each of these plates is equipped with several hinges, allowing them to be shaped into a wide variety of patterns. When these shaped plates are arranged and connected, they can be made to look like almost any basic suit of light or medium metal armor, though armor embellishments such as those worn by high- ranking officers are beyond this device. The arrangement process takes some time, but once it's completed, the user need only perform a few simple adjustments to a clockwork mechanism in the disguise to make the plate arrangement into a new preset configuration. Afterwards, when the user flips a switch on the harness's belt to one of three positions, the plates shift, overlap, and connect as necessary to transform the disguise into the desired preset configuration. The clockwork disguise can have up to three preset configurations at a time, and most users use a minimum of two: the one required for their current task, and a suitably inconspicuous configuration for when the first configuration is unnecessary.</p>\n<p>Giving a clockwork disguise a new preset configuration requires 20 minutes of work. The clockwork disguise can have a maximum of three preset configurations at a time, and it can only mimic light and medium armor suits made of metal.</p>\n<p>The clockwork disguise is light armor and has the following stats, regardless of which type of armor it mimics:</p>\n<p><strong>AC Bonus</strong> +2; <strong>Dex Cap</strong> +3; <strong>Check Penalty</strong> –1; <strong>Strength</strong> 12; <strong>Group</strong> <a href=\"/armor-groups/4\">plate</a>\nFailed to load action-944</p>\n"

    "description": "<p>The clockwork diving suit is a marvel of technology that allows its user to breathe underwater for hours at a time without the aid of magic. Compared to a more traditional magically-assisted diving suit using a <a href=\"/equipment/250\">bottle of air</a>, a clockwork diving suit is both less expensive and better protected, making clockwork diving suits a good choice for characters who prefer more protection. However, they also come with a built-in time limit, which magical diving suits circumvent. A clockwork diving suit is a bulky, fully sealed suit of armor lined with a complex series of filter-equipped bladders that store and circulate air for the user to breathe. A glass faceplate on the front of the helmet allows the user to see what's going on in front of them.</p>\n<p>The suit's rigidity and mechanisms severely restrict the user's range of movement and keeps them from moving faster than a slow walk on the sea floor. To compensate for this, a clockwork water jet mechanism is installed in the suit's back. The water jet includes both a vacuum system and separate air bladder; it's activated with a simple pull of a lever on the suit's belt. When the lever is pulled, the vacuum system sucks in seawater, and seconds later, the air bladder sprays the water out and propels the user short distances. This mechanism is also necessary for the suit to surface without walking to shore—it's too heavy to float on its own. Most wearers can only swim a few feet before sinking back to the water's floor.</p>\n<p>The diving suit contains enough air for three hours of operation, and the clockwork components can operate for up to 3 hours before the suit needs winding. If you run out of air, <a href=\"/rules/468\">drowning and suffocation</a> rules begin to apply as normal. This air supply can be refilled by spending one hour in an area with air, and you can rewind the clockwork in a process that takes 10 minutes to complete.</p>\n<p>The diving suit is a suit of medium armor, and it has the following stats:</p>\n<p><strong>AC Bonus</strong> +4; <strong>Dex Cap</strong> +1; <strong>Check Penalty</strong> –4; <strong>Speed Penalty</strong> –15 ft; <strong>Strength</strong> 18\nFailed to load action-945</p>\n"

This makes a clockwork megaphone far more useful than an ordinary megaphone for situations where you want to make sure that everyone in a particular venue or location can hear you without being so loud that your voice comes across as a painful shout. It takes 1 minute to wind up a clockwork megaphone, which allows it to remain active for up to 1 hour of adjustments, only counting the time you change the megaphone's settings, not the time you spend speaking. Since it automatically enters standby mode when not in use, this typically means you don't have to wind up the clockwork megaphone for months, or even years, depending on how often you adjust the settings each day.</p>\n"

It consists of two flat metal squares, one larger than the other, connected by a tube of leather similar to that found on a bellows. The smaller square, which sits at the front of the device, has a small glass lens in the center of it. The larger square contains a specially treated metallic plate on the inside; its exterior also has both a small control stick connected via flexible wire, and a small metal tube attached to the top and pointing forward. The user presses a button on the control stick to activate the light writer. Upon activation, magical light illuminates the tube, producing a steady light for 20 minutes. This light is captured by the lens and projected onto the metal plate, slowly creating an image of the scene in front of the lens. The plate can then be removed, allowing the image to be displayed anywhere the owner desires. The light writer is mounted on a tripod and must be perfectly still during operation to prevent any defects from appearing in the plate image. If creating a captured image of a living creature, it is equally important for that creature to remain still throughout the process, to avoid a ghostlike blurring of the final image.</p>\n"

While active, it reduces the effects of <a href=\"/rules/642\">severe heat</a> by one step to mild heat, and reduces extreme heat to severe heat. A nightbreeze machine isn't powerful enough to reduce the effects of incredible heat, though fortunately such heat isn't found naturally in the deserts of Rahadoum. A nightbreeze machine runs for 8 hours, after which it must be wound in a process that takes 10 minutes to complete. The 8 hours of activity don't have to be consecutive.</p>\n"

Enter the paper shredder, a clockwork device that performs exactly this function.</p>\n<p>With 1 minute of wind-up, a paper shredder can function for up to 1 hour of shredding, and it automatically enters standby mode when not in use, meaning the device can typically go for weeks between wind-ups unless you shred an exceptionally large volume of paper.</p>\n<p>Setting a piece of paper or parchment into the paper shredder takes a single Interact action, which means you can shred up to three pages of paper or parchment each round. If the page is longer than normal, it takes longer to shred, as determined by the GM. Additionally, only one person can use the shredder each round, limiting it to shredding three pages per round regardless of how many people are available to feed paper into it. The paper shredders rips and tears the paper or parchment apart into tiny disjointed strips. This is typically sufficient to destroy <a href=\"/spells/138\">glyphs of warding</a> and other similar dangerous magical traps on the paper, though the GM might determine that particularly resilient magical traps find some way to survive their shredding. If the paper is magically protected or otherwise has more Hardness than a normal sheet of paper or parchment, the shredder can't shred it. After churning such hardened paper for 1 round, the shredder spits it back out without harming the shredder. This prevents shredding any other paper during that round.</p>\n"

Using the press, a worker can produce up to 3,600 identical pages per day. In order to use the printing press, you must first set the type for the page you want to print. Time required to set type varies depending on the number of characters used; from 1 hour for small pages with brief text, to 8 hours for a full-sized normal page of text, though extreme examples may be outside this range. When you prepare a page for printing, you can include engraved images in addition to text.

    "description": "<p>Wielded in over a hundred duels by the famed Ustalavic noblewoman Countess Tasya Iserav, this <em>+1 <a href=\"/equipment/280\">striking</a> <a href=\"/equipment/731\">fearsome</a> <a href=\"/weapons/201\">dueling pistol</a></em> is a work of master craftsmanship, almost eerie in the axiomatic perfection present in each dimension and detail.</p>\n<p>Commissioned at great expense and artfully designed by a team of the finest gunsmiths, this exquisite mahogany pistol has <a href=\"/equipment/271\">adamantine</a> detailing. The ruby-eyed, leering <a href=\"/monster-families/30\">devil's</a> face that surrounds the barrel was intended to strike fear into the Countess's opponents—of which there were many. Countess Tasya credited this weapon with her exceptional success in dueling circles and refused to name the weapon's creators for fear their works would fall into an opponent's hands. In the past decade, seven replicas of the Countess's famed pistol have arisen, each said to be crafted by the Countess's anonymous gunsmiths. That each of these weapon's wielders have quickly risen to become exceptional duelists in their own right has lent credence to their claims. Despite public pressure, wielders of these replicas have refused to square off against the Countess.</p>\n<p>Despite the weapon's beauty and utility, a <em>pact-bound pistol</em> is a cursed weapon and a physical manifestation of an infernal contract sworn between the bearer of the weapon and the Archdevil <a href=\"/deities/69\">Mephistopheles</a>. Each <em>pact-bound pistol</em> was crafted not by a team of master artisans, but by Countess Tasya Iserav herself, a secret diabolist and devoted priestess of The Crimson Son. The very act of firing the weapon is an acceptance of the contract's terms and causes the weapon to fuse to you. Thereafter, the weapon reappears in your possessions within 1 minute of you discarding it, and can't be destroyed or thrown away permanently, until the curse is removed.</p>\n<p>Whenever you attack a living creature with the <em>pact-bound pistol</em>, text from the infernal contract is seared into your flesh, causing you to lose 1 Hit Point, or 2 Hit Points if the attack was a critical success. The text appears one sentence at a time, from the beginning to the end and is written in <a href=\"/languages/19\">Infernal</a>. When the contract is fully scribed (see below), you no longer lose Hit Points when you attack a living creature. These burned phrases heal over as scars which can't be removed while you are fused to the weapon, although they can be covered and disguised.</p>\n<p>Each time a creature dies within 1 hour of being damaged by a <em>pact-bound pistol</em>, that creature must attempt a DC 25 Will saving throw. On a failure, their soul is consigned to the Archdevil Mephistopheles; their soul immediately goes to <a href=\"/planes/18\">Hell</a> and they can't be returned to life through any means short of divine intervention, a heist, or a successful appeal in the courts of Hell; even powerful magic such as <a href=\"/spells/377\">wish</a> is insufficient. After you have consigned 9 souls to Mephistopheles in this way, the contract is fully scribed upon your flesh. You become immune to <a href=\"/traits/72\">fire</a> damage and the <em>pact-bound pistol</em> becomes a <em>+2 striking greater fearsome dueling pistol</em>. Your soul belongs to Mephistopheles and immediately goes to Hell when you die. You can't be returned to life through any means, even through the divine intervention of a deity.</p>\n<p>Failing to wield a <em>pact-bound pistol</em> is a breach of contract. Each day you go without firing the <em>pact-bound pistol</em> at a living creature, you must attempt a Will saving throw. On a failure, you become <a href=\"/conditions/37\">stupefied 1</a>. If you are already stupefied, the value of your stupefied condition increases by 1, to a maximum of stupefied 4. While you're fused with the <em>pact-bound pistol</em>, you can't reduce the value of your stupefied condition except by damaging a living creature with it. Whenever you damage a living creature with it, if you are suffering from the stupefied condition due to the <em>pact-bound pistol</em>, your stupefied condition is removed.</p>\n"

It's covered on all sides to protect those who cross, granting them greater cover. The end of the sambuca can be lowered by teams operating the pulleys in concert. This requires three crew members on each ship, and they can lower the far end of the sambuca by 15 feet each round they work.</p>\n"

If you critically fail a check to Disarm a metal item using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.

Upon landing, the stone instantly and permanently expands. The stone grows to its maximum size. While normally items with the <a href=\"/traits/153\">structure</a> trait put creatures in their area inside the structure, this effect creates solid stone, so it can't be placed in an area where there are creatures.

The fire doesn't harm the surface on which it was sprinkled, and it can't be extinguished except by fully dousing or submerging it in water, or by smothering it completely.

While it's safe enough to move through the space and edge around the bonfire, a creature remaining in the bonfire for at least a full round takes 1d6 fire damage each round.

The weather is calm and free from extreme weather conditions (such as blizzards, hail, thunderstorms, and tornadoes), and the sky remains clear.

The thickness of the band allows it to be taken to any jeweler or blacksmith to be adjusted to different hands or fingers from the original make. There is a tiny clasp at the side of the gem that, when pressed, opens the gem, revealing a small, hinged compartment. This compartment is designed to hold one dose of poison, allowing wearers to slip the contents of the ring into the food or drink of an intended target. The compartment can be closed again by gently pressing the gem back into place. Noticing the compartment requires a DC 15 Perception check for anyone inspecting the ring.</p>\n"

    "description": "<p>Many secret societies dabble in ancient lore and rare antiquities. If one were to ask what their greatest challenge is, instead of evading police attention or dealing with the occasional mystic curse, most members would say it's separating counterfeit goods from real ones. Almost anything can be counterfeited, and counterfeiting is a major criminal enterprise with its own tricks, techniques, and intricacies. Some counterfeiters specialize in the production of adulterated coinage, while others produce beautiful legal documents with forged signatures and stolen stamps. Another class of forger produces artwork in the style of some great master, while ancient relics can be churned out by the dozen in subterranean workshops.</p>\n<p>You can hire a counterfeiter to create low-grade, medium-grade, or high-grade counterfeit goods. In all cases, the goods can still act as mundane examples of their type (a counterfeit copy of the queen's <a href=\"/weapons/31\">longsword</a> is still a longsword), and if the original is enchanted, then the counterfeiter attempts to fake the appropriate magical auras. Counterfeit goods don't have any other magical powers, though—a counterfeit scroll can't be used to Cast a Spell, for example. A counterfeit good can't be cheaper than the base item. For example, the sword couldn't be cheaper than a longsword, nor the scroll cheaper than a piece of parchment.</p>\n<p>An item sold to a store goes through a rigorous vetting process that is extremely likely to detect a counterfeit, so a secret society member can't simply create counterfeits and then sell them at a profit. Counterfeits excel in situations where the item's hand-off is illicit or the item doesn't need to pass intense scrutiny from an appraiser.</p>\n<p><strong>Detecting Counterfeits</strong>: Determining something is counterfeit requires inspecting the item and succeeding at a relevant skill check against the counterfeit's DC. Typically, this is <a href=\"/skills/4\">Crafting</a>, but one might use <a href=\"/skills/13\">Religion</a> to detect a fake reliquary or <a href=\"/skills/9\">Medicine</a> to realize a potion is mere snake oil. Low-grade counterfeits typically have a <a href=\"/rules/552\">very easy DC of the item's level</a>, medium-grade counterfeits typically have a standard DC of the item's level, and high-grade counterfeits typically have a hard DC of the item's level.</p>\n<h2 id=\"counterfeit-item-low-gradeitem-0\">Counterfeit Item (Low-Grade)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/129\">Dark Archive</a> pg. 83</p>\n<h2 id=\"counterfeit-item-medium-gradeitem-0\">Counterfeit Item (Medium-Grade)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/129\">Dark Archive</a> pg. 83</p>\n<h2 id=\"counterfeit-item-high-gradeitem-0\">Counterfeit Item (High-Grade)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/129\">Dark Archive</a> pg. 83</p>\n"

Lucky thieves have a friend who is willing to be an alibi; for everyone else, there's the false witness, a professional in the art of fraudulent testimony.</p>\n<p>Some false witnesses are truly freelance, willing to claim to have seen someone for the price of a round of drinks. More respectable witnesses, however, tend to be associated with thieves' guilds, secret societies, and other conspiracies. Such organizations can match a person in need of an alibi with a witness with no apparent connection to them, and they often have large enough numbers that no one witness appears before law enforcement often enough to arouse suspicion. The most expensive and professional false witnesses use memory charms or similar techniques to render their testimony foolproof. Typically, a false witness charges per incident, providing a false alibi and, if necessary, hiring other witnesses to back themselves up and thus foul an investigation.</p>\n<p>False witnesses generally know better than to ask questions, but depending on their background, might refuse to protect—and might even turn in—someone involved in a particularly heinous crime. A tavern keeper might have no qualms about covering for burglars and footpads but will gladly send a child murderer to the gallows.</p>\n<p><strong>Detecting False Testimony</strong>: To defeat a false witness's testimony, an investigator must succeed at a check against the DC listed in the table. The check used depends on the investigation: Perception to <a href=\"/actions/85\">Sense Motive</a> versus spoken testimony, <a href=\"/skills/14\">Society</a> to determine forgeries, and so on.

Members can rub elbows with the great and good, introduce themselves to politicians and powerbrokers, and form bonds through shared allegiances unavailable to the common rabble. They can lean on those connections for a favor, some little trifle that might matter a great deal to them.</p>\n<p>Purchasing political favors typically requires membership in a secret society that has significant political sway in the region (such as the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye in Ustalav). At the GM's discretion, characters with similarly deep connections (perhaps by virtue of having the royalty background) might also be able to purchase political favors. While the options below assume the favors are being purchased with cash, in most secret societies, favors are more likely to be traded for other favors or services rendered. The granter of the favor isn't necessarily a member of a secret society, but anyone in high office is invariably entangled in webs of favor and obligation.</p>\n<p>The degree of the favor is based on how much effort it requires of the decision-maker and how much risk to which it exposes them. This can vary depending on the NPC.

    "description": "<p>Sisterstone is a term used for two closely related ores infused by the spiritual runoff in the Field of Maidens, dusk sisterstone and scarlet sisterstone. They have the same physical properties except for color—dusk sisterstone is a pale orange while scarlet sisterstone is orange-red. When near an object made of the other type of sisterstone, they both begin exuding spiritual energy that repels <a href=\"/traits/160\">undead</a>.</p>\n<p>When an object made of dusk sisterstone is within 15 feet of an object made of scarlet sisterstone of the same grade, they create a reciprocal field. Any undead creature adjacent to one of the objects when the field is formed, or who moves adjacent to one while the field is active, becomes <a href=\"/conditions/13\">enfeebled 1</a> unless it succeeds at a DC 15 Fortitude save. This lasts until the undead creature is no longer adjacent to either of the items or until the field's removed (typically by the objects ceasing to be within 15 feet of one another). The DC increases to 22 if both items are standard grade or better, and to 33 if they're both high grade. Unworked chunks and ingots don't create a reciprocal field. A single object can't be made of both types of sisterstone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sisterstone-items\">Sisterstone Items</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Sisterstone

If she could gain control over the cult, she could simultaneously use them to open the Lower Vault and convince them to set aside their worship of Droskar—if not for her own patron, <a href=\"/deities/4\">Cayden Cailean</a>, then any other faith with a more positive leaning.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, her attempt to seize control of the cult using their own traditions against them backfired when she succumbed to the Soul Smith. Unlike the others who were slain by the Soul Smith, Azarim's soul managed to somewhat escape being bound into the Soul Smith's soul chain by instead seeking shelter in her own magic rapier.

    "description": "<p>Originally, this magical crown was to be known as the _Crown of Toil_—a magic item crafted by the dwarven priest named Gristogar. He intended for the crown to bolster his ability to rule and herald in a new era of a dwarven kingdom that followed the teachings of <a href=\"/deities/28\">Droskar</a>. Yet Gristogar wasn't equal to his own ambitions, and before he could complete the <em>Crown of Toil</em>, his cult died out and he ended his own life. For centuries, the incomplete crown lay dormant, but over that time, fragments of Gristogar's soul infused it—not enough to transform it into a truly intelligent item, but enough to give it a rudimentary need and desire to be completed.</p>\n<p>When the Kobold King Merlokrep discovered the discarded crown and placed it upon his head, the crown at last had agency— if not in a hale and hearty dwarf, at least in the frame of a powerful and ambitious kobold. Just as the crown began influencing Merlokrep, so too did the Kobold King's personality influence the crown. Today, the device is known as the <em>Crown of the Kobold King</em>, and while it still urges the one who wears it to build a kingdom of endlessly toiling workers, it no longer does so in honor of Droskar. Instead, it seeks the rise of a brutal kobold kingdom.</p>\n<p>The crown appears as a golden band surrounded by iron spikes that glisten with fresh blood—the addition of a kobold skull to the top is largely decorative, but one the crown has grown to “enjoy.” Even in its incomplete state, a few rituals away from its true potential, the <em>Crown of the Kobold King</em> is a potent item. Wearing the crown grants you a +2 item bonus to <a href=\"/skills/7\">Intimidation</a> checks and a +1 item bonus to saving throws against <a href=\"/traits/68\">fear</a> effects.\nFailed to load action-1317Failed to load action-1318</p>\n"

They entrusted <em>Briar's</em> safe keeping to <a href=\"/deities/95\">the Lantern King</a>, who mischievously kept moving the sword from world to world, always near to the regions Nyrissa was focused on but always hidden from her so that he could privately enjoy the delicious irony that the thing she sought so ardently was always kept just out of reach.</p>\n<p>When first recovered by the PCs, <em>Briar</em> is a <em>+3 <a href=\"/equipment/280\">greater striking</a> <a href=\"/equipment/375\">cold iron</a> <a href=\"/weapons/15\">bastard sword</a></em>, but its additional powers remain dormant. These powers can be awakened as the PCs progress through Chapter 10. The process of awakening <em>Briar</em> requires that the weapon be present when <a href=\"/planes/10\">First World</a> blooms are defeated or when powerful creatures from the First World are slain—<em>Briar</em> need not be the weapon that defeats a bloom or slays a monster, but it must be in the immediate area (within 500 feet). Defeating a bloom or slaying a 17th-level or greater monster from the First World— including all creatures closely associated with a bloom—gives <em>Briar</em> a Sharpness Point. As it accumulates these points, it gains additional powers, as detailed below.</p>\n<p>Once <em>Briar</em> gains the capability to speak, it can relate to its partner the sad tale of its creation, including the fact that it was created by the Lantern King using Nyrissa's capacity to love. <em>Briar</em> knows that without love, Nyrissa is as good as dead, and it suspects that only by being used to slay Nyrissa can it be returned to her soul. It doesn't know about the Lantern King's additional machinations, the nature of the <em>Apology</em>, or Nyrissa's reasons for attacking the Stolen Lands, and as such doesn't realize there is another method to be reunited with the nymph queen—see the end of Chapter 10.</p>\n<p>The first time <em>Briar</em> is brought within 30 feet of Nyrissa, it automatically gains enough Sharpness Points to reach 20 points.</p>\n<p><strong>1 Sharpness Point</strong> <em>Briar</em> becomes a <em>+3 greater striking <a href=\"/equipment/302\">shifting</a> cold iron bastard sword</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>4 Sharpness Points</strong> <em>Briar</em> becomes a <em>+3 major striking shifting cold iron bastard sword</em>.

If its partner goes too long without fighting, the sword misleads its wielder into believing they're the real Armag and that anyone around them who isn't obviously a member of their lineage or following is a mortal enemy. The cursed greatsword also slowly changes the features of the wielder over the course of several days or even weeks to appear as those of the original Armag. If left unchecked, these powers seemingly bring the warlord back to life—it's the wait for this subtle transformation to be complete that's kept the current “Armag” in meditation in the tomb for so long. The long-term effects on a PC as a result of this curse are left to the GM to adjudicate, but at the very least should result in a gradual shift of the PCs' alignment to chaotic neutral.

You can't etch property runes onto a <em>rod of razors</em>. The rod of razors has a long-lasting internal power source that does not require recharging from batteries (unlike the mindrender baton—see page 586), but if the rod of razors becomes <a href=\"/conditions/2\">broken</a>, its power supply grows unreliable. In such a case, each time the rod of razors is activated, the user must also succeed at a DC 5 flat check. Failure indicates that the rod's power supply fails and causes the rod to explode. This destroys the rod and causes 10d6 piercing damage and 10d6 slashing damage to the rod's wielder (DC 36 <a href=\"/rules/329\">basic</a> Reflex save). Additionally, if the rod is destroyed through other means, the rod's current wielder must make a successful DC 11 flat check to avoid having the rod explode in the same way. Stories of desperate people intentionally destroying a rod of razors as a last ditch attack have inadvertently given these Numearian weapons a poor reputation among certain circles in that nation, particularly with the Technic League, who regard those who fight with these weapons as fools.\nFailed to load action-1361</p>\n"

While these dusters can't turn away gunfire entirely, their utility, affordability, and comfort ensure their popularity, especially among the city's shieldmarshals, who have adopted them as a sort of unofficial uniform. A plated duster can be donned with 2 Interact actions or as part of donning light armor. When worn with light armor from the cloth, leather, or chain groups, a plated duster increases the armor's item bonus to AC by 1, worsens the armor's check penalty by 1, reduces the armor's Dex cap by 1, increases the Strength score required to ignore the armor check penalty and Speed penalty by 2, adds the <a href=\"/traits/205\">noisy</a> trait, and changes the armor's group to <a href=\"/armor-groups/2\">composite</a>. This also makes the armor one step heavier (from light to medium), and you use the proficiency bonus appropriate to this adjusted armor type. You can't use a plated duster alongside an <a href=\"/equipment/514\">armored skirt</a> or any other item that adjusts an armor's statistics.</p>\n"

On a critical failure on any saving throw against condensed mana, the creature is stunned 1 by the wild energies of the surge.</p>\n<p>Sometimes a wellspring surge's effects make it difficult to determine exactly who is affected. The GM makes the determination, basing it on creatures directly affected; for example, while many creatures can hear the music from the surge “strike up the band,” only the creature emanating the music is directly affected by it.</p>\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> You must be in or adjacent to an area of Mana Wastes miasma.</p>\n"

The mirror reflects its surroundings in muted colors, and any living creatures that look into the mirror see themselves as preserved corpses with sallow skin, sunken cheeks, and a vacant expression. The mirror is mounted in a bone frame intricately carved with imagery of corvids, keys, and winding roads. These roads represent the Dead Roads, the secret back routes between the <a href=\"/planes/15\">Boneyard</a> and all other planes that are under the purview of the <a href=\"/monster-families/83\">psychopomp</a> usher <a href=\"/deities/138\">Barzahk the Passage</a> and their followers.</p>\n<p><em>Passage panes</em> are created by incredibly powerful priests of Barzahk using mirrors that have reflected Barzahk during their travels from when Barzahk passes through mortal realms. Through prayer, powerful magic, and exceptional crafting skill, these mirrors form a spiritual connection to the Dead Roads, which can be harnessed to open a gate to the Boneyard.</p>\n<p>To utilize a <em>passage pane</em>, the mirror must be securely mounted on a solid surface. Once mounted, a user must bond with the <em>passage pane</em> by gazing beyond their dead visage into the Dead Roads. Bonding takes patience and can only be accomplished by a living creature who has at least master proficiency in <a href=\"/skills/13\">Religion</a> and who succeeds at a DC 40 Religion check.

Legends state the Crowned Regent Kaldemash helped forge one of the first star guns millennia ago. While the star gun served Kaldemash as a powerful weapon, its most notable achievement was the accidental killing of one of Kaldemash's greatest friends. This death is what caused the regent to recognize the true destructive power of the star guns and led to him developing the Star Code, a set of rules of engagement and proper use of firearms still in use in Arcadia today. Although Kaldemash never named the weapon himself, all legends that mention the weapon refer to it as <em>Kaldemash's Lament</em>.</p>\n<p>The legendary weapon is a <em>+3 <a href=\"/equipment/280\">major striking</a> <a href=\"/equipment/304\">speed</a></em> advanced firearm with a range increment of 90 feet. It deals 4d6 force damage (with the <em>major striking</em> rune included) and has the <a href=\"/traits/327\">concealable</a>, <a href=\"/traits/401\">concussive</a>, and <a href=\"/traits/178\">fatal d10</a> traits. You don't take a penalty when dealing nonlethal damage with the weapon. Like most star guns, <em>Kaldemash's Lament</em> uses magic to function and doesn't require ammunition or <a href=\"/equipment/1190\">black powder</a>.</p>\n<p>If you use <em>Kaldemash's Lament</em> as part of a duel in which all parties are in agreement on the terms, the gun's supernatural instincts help you make the quickest draw. You roll twice and take the higher result on your initiative roll for the duel; this is a <a href=\"/traits/76\">fortune</a> effect. In addition, you can draw <em>Kaldemash's Lament</em> as a free action at the start of your turn during the duel. If you attempt to fire the star gun in bad faith at a dueling opponent once they have surrendered, been defeated, or the duel is over, <em>Kaldemash's Lament</em> flies out of your hand and you can't pick it up, hold it, or wield it for 10 minutes.\nFailed to load action-1584Failed to load action-1585Failed to load action-1586</p>\n"

Choose one of the following traits when activating the fulus: <a href=\"/traits/23\">celestial</a>, <a href=\"/traits/57\">elemental</a>, <a href=\"/traits/69\">fey</a>, <a href=\"/traits/70\">fiend</a>, <a href=\"/traits/111\">monitor</a>, or <a href=\"/traits/160\">undead</a>. If a creature with that trait starts its turn in the area, it must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude saving throw or become <a href=\"/conditions/34\">sickened 2</a> until the start of its next turn. On a critical success, the creature becomes temporarily immune to any anathema fulus for 1 hour. Regardless of the save result, if you subsequently cast <a href=\"/spells/19\">banishment</a> on such a creature in the area, the creature takes the –2 penalty described in that spell for using a material component that's anathema to that creature. The fulu acts as that component; you don't need to add it. If a creature affected by this penalty rolls a saving throw against banishment, the caster can use a free action to force the result one step lower. Doing so burns the whole fulu out, ending the effect. If any of the fulu's pieces are moved or destroyed after activation, the effect ends.</p>\n"

    "description": "<p>A <em>sentry fulu</em> depicts an armed guard. When you activate the fulu, it takes the shape of a Tiny humanoid guard made of paper and keeps watch over an area in a 20-foot burst. The guard has a Perception DC of 20, along with <a href=\"/rules/411\">precise</a> visual senses and <a href=\"/rules/412\">imprecise</a> hearing and vibrational sense to detect creatures moving in its area, including through the air. You dictate whether the guard remains still in its area or patrols it; if the latter, you also determine the path the guard takes, at a Speed of 25 feet. You also determine a password others must give the guard to bypass it. If a creature enters the area without giving the password, the sentry creates either an audible or mental alarm. An audible alarm has the sound and volume of a human shouting, as well as the <a href=\"/traits/16\">auditory</a> trait, allowing each creature that can hear it to attempt a DC 15 Perception check to wake up if they're asleep. The mental alert reaches you if you're within 60 feet of the active guard (see below). The guard remains active for 8 hours, and then the fulu is consumed.</p>\n<p>If you have more than one <em>sentry fulu</em>, you can set up several that function as a unit, provided their areas touch or overlap. When one sounds its alarm, the alarm passes through all of them, so you must be within range of only one to hear it or receive the mental alert. Creatures that give the correct password to one <em>sentry fulu</em> in a unit need not give that password again to the others. The destruction of one fulu-created guard in a unit sets off the alarm in others in connected areas.</p>\n"

Whenever you roll initiative, you become confused for up to 1d4 rounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 4</strong> You die.</p>\n<p><strong>Purging</strong> You must find and slay a chaotic evil aberration or a servant of such creatures the GM deems appropriate.

It deserves its reputation for dooming those who possess it to die, but scholars debate whether the codex causes this fate or merely acts as its harbinger.</p>\n<p>The <em>Dullahan Codex</em> is a jet-black tome bearing a single rune embossed on its cover, and it functions as a <em><a href=\"/equipment/992\">true endless grimoire</a></em>. Inside, scrawled across its parchment pages in a delicate, spidery script, is a lengthy list of names that always appears in a reader's native alphabet.

(On a critical failure with this ritual, the codex adds all casters to its list.) You can redirect the curse by inscribing another person's name in the grimoire and succeeding at a DC 40 <a href=\"/skills/2\">Arcana</a> or <a href=\"/skills/11\">Occultism</a> check.

    "description": "<p>Knowledge is often the key to a successful venture, and canaries are boots on the ground who can get the information you need to carry out your missions. Sometimes, you may need to gather information in an area or culture you're not familiar with, and you may need to do so without being seen or in advance of your arrival to that location. Utilizing a local network of eyes and ears is often the best way to carry out this type of reconnaissance. Organizations like the Firebrands have large networks of canaries scattered throughout the Inner Sea region capable of gathering information or following specific targets, and some Firebrands may even be canaries themselves.</p>\n<p>Discretion and confidentiality are two of the most important values for any member of a canary network. If an individual's identity or role is revealed, it can spell death—or worse—for them and the rest of the network. To help minimize this risk, canaries know only one or two other individuals within the network and never share the identities of others with their clients. In some cases, this network of informants may have two members residing in the same household without knowing that they're both involved. Due to this secretive nature, information must be passed securely— parchment slips baked into your bread or dropped into your pocket, a letter slipped under your door, a confirmation whispered into your ear.</p>\n<p>Canaries come in two varieties: informants and tails. A canary informant automatically <a href=\"/actions/75\">Aids</a> you on attempts to <a href=\"/actions/49\">Gather Information</a> about a specific person, a locale, rumors spreading in the area, or movements of enemy forces, granting you a +1 circumstance bonus to your checks. Advanced canary informants critically succeed at Aiding you, granting you a +2 circumstance bonus to your check.</p>\n<p>Canary tails follow a specific individual. For each week that they are hired, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on your check to Gather Information on the movements and mannerisms of the individual, up to a maximum of four weeks for a +4 bonus. After four weeks, the individual typically begins to suspect they are being tailed and shifts their schedule, limits their exposure, or otherwise changes their behavior to throw off any tails. The cost of this service increases over the weeks due to the increased risk posed to canaries by longer durations.</p>\n<p>The GM decides whether a canary network is in place for any given location and whether that network is able to collect the information needed to support you. In most cases, settlements of 5th level and higher have some kind of canary network in place; the network in a lower-level settlement might be sparser, requiring more time or higher payments, as determined by the GM. In some instances, canary networks might already know the exact information you are searching for and can provide the information forthright for the cost of one week of advanced services. For example, the network could already be keeping a list of corrupt bankers living in a specific city district and provide that information for 35 gp. The exact nature of each banker's corruption may be considered a different piece of information and require additional payments. Prices may be much higher for very specific information or information that took great effort for the network to acquire.</p>\n<h2 id=\"canary-informant-basic-servicesitem-0\">Canary Informant (Basic Services)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 92</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 2 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Ammunition</strong> per target, per day</p>\n<h2 id=\"canary-informant-advanced-servicesitem-0\">Canary Informant (Advanced Services)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 92</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 5 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Ammunition</strong> per target, per day</p>\n<h2 id=\"canary-tail-first-weekitem-0\">Canary Tail (First Week)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 92</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 10 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Ammunition</strong> per week</p>\n<h2 id=\"canary-tail-second-weekitem-0\">Canary Tail (Second Week)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 92</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 20 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Ammunition</strong> per week</p>\n<h2 id=\"canary-tail-third-weekitem-0\">Canary Tail (Third Week)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 92</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 40 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Ammunition</strong> per week</p>\n<h2 id=\"canary-tail-fourth-weekitem-0\">Canary Tail (Fourth Week)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 92</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 80 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Ammunition</strong> per week</p>\n"

    "description": "<p>Venturing away from home or into the wilderness can be dangerous, especially when the terrain and local creatures are unfamiliar. Guide services reduce the risk of danger during an expedition as guides know the safest or the quickest routes to take through various areas. They also can arrange transportation, food, lodging, and other resources needed for a journey. Guides can assist with locating specific flora or fauna, which is particularly helpful for those in search of ingredients for alchemy or a ritual.</p>\n<p>Guide services typically focus on either wilderness or survival. Wilderness guides are familiar with the terrain and the habits of the creatures who dwell in the region. They can guide you through unfamiliar or hazardous locations using an expedient route, which is the standard route that covers the distance in the shortest amount of time regardless of the hazards you may face, or using a safe route, which doubles your travel time but minimizes the risk of running into <a href=\"/conditions/23\">hostile</a> creatures.</p>\n<p>Survival guides have knowledge of subjects of their level plus 4, so a 1st-level survival guide can help locate targets of up to 5th level. Targets can include creatures, specific plants, or even specific locations such as a glade with a direct view of an upcoming eclipse. The level of a target is either the level of the creature or the level of the challenge used to determine the DC for locating the target, as determined by the GM. For example, the GM might determine that finding a suitable glade would be a challenge for 6th-level characters and require a 2nd-level survival guide to locate. A survival guide can locate a target of their level or lower in 1 day, adding 1 additional day for each level that the target is above the guide's own level.</p>\n<p>Guides typically specialize in particular locations, regions, or routes. If you plan to hire a guide, you must hire one for the appropriate task at hand. The GM can decide that an appropriate guide is unavailable in a given location, requiring you to look elsewhere. For example, you're unlikely to find a guide in Magnimar who can take you across the Wall of Heaven in Tian Xia, but you're likely to find a guide in Goka with the requisite knowledge and experience to do so. Particularly harsh regions or obscure targets might have increased costs, up to 10 times the normal price for their services. Dangerous locales or rare targets may be outside the capabilities of a guide and are best reserved as something that PCs must handle themselves. Organizations like the Firebrands sometimes set up their own guiding services, most notably to assist refugees in crossing remote or dangerous locations. Firebrands may also hire guides to aid in finding specific locations, plants, or creatures in a locale.</p>\n<h2 id=\"guide-expedient-wilderness-guideitem-0\">Guide (Expedient Wilderness Guide)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 93</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 6 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Ammunition</strong> per day</p>\n<h2 id=\"guide-safe-wilderness-guideitem-0\">Guide (Safe Wilderness Guide)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 93</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 4 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Ammunition</strong> per day</p>\n<h2 id=\"guide-survival-guide-level-1-traineditem-0\">Guide (Survival Guide Level 1; Trained)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 93</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 4 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Ammunition</strong> per day</p>\n<h2 id=\"guide-survival-guide-level-2item-0\">Guide (Survival Guide Level 2)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 93</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 10 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Ammunition</strong> per day</p>\n<h2 id=\"guide-survival-guide-level-3-expertitem-0\">Guide (Survival Guide Level 3; Expert)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 93</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 20 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Ammunition</strong> per day</p>\n<h2 id=\"guide-survival-guide-level-4item-0\">Guide (Survival Guide Level 4)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 93</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 50 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Ammunition</strong> per day</p>\n"

    "description": "<p>Item caches serve as places where you can pick up supplies, and suppliers are the people or organizations who provide the items and locations for these caches. This service is useful for scheduling a quick resupply of food along a specified route during a long journey, or for setting up specific items that need to be accessed at an appointed time and place, such as having a cache of weapons accessible to an infiltration party behind enemy lines. On popular travel routes, Firebrands and other adventuring groups have regular access points where they can easily set up a resource drop, thanks to suppliers who are typically supportive locals and who make a small income off running supplies to drop locations.</p>\n<p>Cached items carry an automatic 10% markup in addition to a flat fee determined by the rarity and Bulk of the items in total. The price of the cache includes the cost of sourcing the items requested. The maximum item level available for cached items is typically equal to the maximum allowed by the level of the city or settlement. <a href=\"/traits/67\">Extradimensional</a> spaces such as <a href=\"/equipment/249\">bags of holding</a> can be used for item caches, and the cost of those specialized containers must be paid in advance.

Caches larger than 50 Bulk draw too much attention and must either be broken up into multiple smaller caches or be arranged as alternate deliveries, such as a shipment to a local and trusted warehouse. If you are supplying all the items for an item cache, you need only to pay the flat fee for a common item cache of the appropriate level for the Bulk contained, regardless of the rarity of the items being held in the cache.</p>\n<h2 id=\"item-cache-common-cache-level-1item-0\">Item Cache (Common Cache Level 1)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 93</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 2 gp</p>\n<h2 id=\"item-cache-common-cache-level-2item-0\">Item Cache (Common Cache Level 2)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 93</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 5 gp</p>\n<h2 id=\"item-cache-common-cache-level-3item-0\">Item Cache (Common Cache Level 3)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 93</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 10 gp</p>\n<h2 id=\"item-cache-common-cache-level-4item-0\">Item Cache (Common Cache Level 4)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 93</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 50 gp</p>\n<h2 id=\"item-cache-uncommon-cache-level-1item-0\">Item Cache (Uncommon Cache Level 1)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 93</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 10 gp</p>\n<h2 id=\"item-cache-uncommon-cache-level-2item-0\">Item Cache (Uncommon Cache Level 2)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 93</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 50 gp</p>\n<h2 id=\"item-cache-uncommon-cache-level-3item-0\">Item Cache (Uncommon Cache Level 3)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 93</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 100 gp</p>\n<h2 id=\"item-cache-uncommon-cache-level-4item-0\">Item Cache (Uncommon Cache Level 4)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 93</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 250 gp</p>\n"

    "description": "<p>Propaganda is strongly biased information presented in a way that may mislead those who are exposed to it. Most commonly, propaganda is used to drive a specific political agenda. While this is oftentimes a tool utilized by regimes to maintain a specific image among their oppressed people, the Firebrands use propaganda to bring shocking truths to light, drive wedges between enemy factions, and encourage uprisings against tyrannical regimes. Many groups of Firebrands specialize in the creation and dissemination of propaganda, though they are just as likely to utilize local resources to do the disseminating for them. When used at the correct time and place, propagandists can adjust the temperature of the political climate to tear down tyrants and shift the narrative in a way that evokes specific sentiments, like hope or anger, and thus inspires rebellious action.</p>\n<p>Spreading propaganda occurs over the course of days because it typically requires time for its widespread dissemination through physical flyers and word of mouth. Once you select a specific subject for your propaganda, it typically takes 1d4+2 days for a propagandist to compose and then disseminate their work. Twice as long is required if the propaganda is contradictory to existing rumors or to the opinions of those viewing or reading it, but only half as long is necessary if the propaganda supports existing rumors and public opinion. Propaganda typically influences an entire settlement or area, though the GM can determine that it only influences specific areas like a city district in a larger city or even a single neighborhood. In these cases, you should be able to pay for more propaganda services to influence additional areas.</p>\n<p>The level of the propagandist determines how effective they and their team are at influencing the mindset of the people. The GM rolls a <a href=\"/traits/142\">secret</a> check using the bonus of the propagandist against the DC required to <a href=\"/actions/49\">Gather Information</a> on the given subject of the propaganda. On a success, the propaganda takes hold, becoming the talk of the people for 1 week, or 1 month on a critical success. On a failure, the propaganda is unsuccessful but is otherwise ignored. On a critical failure, the propaganda backfires, and further attempts at propaganda related to that subject fail for 1 week.

    "description": "<p>Safe houses are locations that are difficult to find and provide sanctuary for groups or individuals in need of a suitable hiding place to lie low. These locations may be utilized by spies seeking refuge from enemies, accused criminals running from unjust or corrupt law enforcement, or any number of others sheltering from a hostile, unsafe, or oppressive situation. Many Firebrands make use of a safe house or set one up themselves in the course of their journeys to keep their presence hidden from spies or to find refuge while fleeing from dangerous locations.</p>\n<p>The costs associated with each level is the amount of money required to commission and establish a safe house of that level. This includes renting, purchasing, or constructing the location, bribing any informants for their discretion, and securing routes to and from the safe house in case of emergency. The cost of access to a safe house increases with the level of security it provides. Any creature attempting to locate a safe house must spend at least 2 hours to attempt to <a href=\"/actions/49\">Gather Information</a> on the  location, the DC of which is determined by the safe house's level. The DC of the check required to locate a given safe house is reduced by 1 for each day that the safe house remains in use. For this reason, a particular location is typically used for a maximum of three days, so longer stays in an area require movement between multiple locations. Once the location of a safe house has been compromised, it can't be used as a safe house again until significant time has passed or significant changes have occurred to the location, as determined by the GM.</p>\n<p>The GM determines the location and availability of a safe house along with its level. Costs for a safe house may be inflated for secure locations deep within enemy territory. Safe houses with higher security provide increased bonuses against hostile attempts to Gather Information to locate their targets. Level 1 safe houses are the least secure, but they're more widely available and more affordable as they're typically short-term rental houses or nooks in abandoned warehouses. Level 2 safe houses might be a hidden hut erected in a remote location or a secret room aboard a ship. Level 3 safe houses, being protected by a magical veil, a protocol of timed access, or a ferocious guardian beast, are challenging to locate for all but the most skilled seekers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"safe-house-level-1item-0\">Safe House (Level 1)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 94</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 10 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Ammunition</strong> per day</p>\n<p>DC 26</p>\n<h2 id=\"safe-house-level-2item-0\">Safe House (Level 2)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 94</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 100 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Ammunition</strong> per day</p>\n<p>DC 26</p>\n<h2 id=\"safe-house-level-3item-0\">Safe House (Level 3)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 94</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 1,000 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Ammunition</strong> per day</p>\n<p>DC 32</p>\n"

    "description": "<p>Smuggling involves the discrete transport of people or goods. Examples include moving weapons through a neutral nation to supply a hidden army, transporting endangered creatures out of hostile territory for protection, and dispersing stolen resources to the needy. While smugglers are often associated with illicit substances and illegal activities, Firebrands use smuggling as a way to move people and resources undetected across great distances; they do this by using their own networks or by hiring local experts. Many of the Firebrands' operations involve spectacles as misdirection, and it's not uncommon for them to cause a stir to allow goods to be smuggled more easily elsewhere. In particular, they work with the Bellflower Network to aid in the relocation of displaced peoples across borders.</p>\n<p>Smugglers transport goods by either taking unconventional routes, offering bribes to guards and inspectors, hiding smuggled goods or people, or disguising or declaring the goods as something different. Borders and conflict zones are areas where smuggling thrives, although smaller or more specialized rings can be found all across the Inner Sea region. Smuggling rings typically operate along particular routes or between specific locations, and the availability of smuggling services and the capacity of those services is up to GM discretion.</p>\n<p>The cost of smuggling services depends on distance, as determined by the level of service, and includes transportation fees and a fund for the bribes required to have inspectors look the other way. Level 1 services accept items up to 25 Bulk or a single creature, level 2 services accept items up to 100 Bulk or 3 creatures, level  3 services accept items up to 200 Bulk or 6 creatures, level 4 services accept items up to 300 Bulk or 10 creatures, and level 5 services accept items up to 500 Bulk or up to 20 creatures. More dangerous or difficult subjects of transport, such as explosives or high-level creatures, generally double the cost of the service.</p>\n<p>Smuggling services are generally presumed to succeed. In some cases, the GM might rule that the smuggling could fail, leading to the discovery and possible capture of the goods or people, but GMs are encouraged to warn the players in such cases and offer alternatives, such as paying a higher cost for a more secure smuggling attempt or smuggling the goods themselves.</p>\n<h2 id=\"smuggling-level-1item-0\">Smuggling (Level 1)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 95</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 10 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Ammunition</strong> per 50 miles</p>\n<h2 id=\"smuggling-level-2item-0\">Smuggling (Level 2)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 95</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 20 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Ammunition</strong> per 50 miles</p>\n<h2 id=\"smuggling-level-3item-0\">Smuggling (Level 3)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 95</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 50 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Ammunition</strong> per 50 miles</p>\n<h2 id=\"smuggling-level-4item-0\">Smuggling (Level 4)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 95</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 90 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Ammunition</strong> per 50 miles</p>\n<h2 id=\"smuggling-level-5item-0\">Smuggling (Level 5)Item 0</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <a href=\"/sources/196\">Firebrands</a> pg. 95</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong> 150 gp</p>\n<p><strong>Ammunition</strong> per 50 miles</p>\n"
