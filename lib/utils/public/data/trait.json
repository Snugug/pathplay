Instead, when summoned, the incarnate creature takes its Arrive action when you finish Casting the Spell. At the end of your next turn, the incarnate creature can either Step, Stride, or take the action for another movement type it has (such as <a href=\"/actions/33\">Climb</a> or <a href=\"/actions/93\">Burrow</a>), and then takes its Depart action. The spell then ends. The names of specific Arrive and Depart actions are listed in italics after the word “Arrive” or “Depart” respectively, along with any traits.</p>\n<p>A creature summoned by an incarnate spell acts in your interests, directs its effects away from you and your allies as much as possible, and might listen to your requests, but ultimately makes its own decisions. If the spell indicates that the incarnate makes a decision, the GM determines what the incarnate would do. It might even become more inclined to do precisely as you wish over multiple summonings.</p>\n<p>The incarnate is not fully a creature. It can't take any other actions, nor can it be targeted or harmed by Strikes, spells, or other effects unless they would be able to target or end a spell effect (such as <a href=\"/spells/78\">dispel magic</a>). It has a size for the purposes of determining its placement for effects, but it doesn't block movement. If applicable, its effects use your spell DCs and spell attack roll modifier.</p>\n"

In this case, the combination weapon returns to its melee usage after the ranged weapon Strike.</p>\n<p>Since a combination weapon is one weapon with two usages, both usages share any <a href=\"/equipment/runes/fundamental-weapon-runes\">fundamental runes</a>. You can put a property rune on a combination weapon as long as it's appropriate for either of the two usages, but if only one of the usages meets the property rune's requirements, the effects of the property rune only apply for that usage. For instance, a <em><a href=\"/equipment/308\">vorpal</a> <a href=\"/weapons/213\">axe musket</a></em> only applies the <em>vorpal</em> property rune when you're using it as an axe. Due to their complexity, combination weapons can't have another weapon, such as a <a href=\"/weapons/186\">bayonet</a> or <a href=\"/weapons/187\">reinforced stock</a>, attached to them.</p>\n"

You can make either a spell attack roll with a spellgun or a ranged attack roll using your proficiency with simple <a href=\"/weapon-groups/16\">firearms</a>. Spellguns have a range increment, which applies regardless of which type of attack roll you make. Though you can use your modifier for simple firearms, a spellgun isn't actually a firearm. You don't get the damage of a firearm Strike, nor other benefits like <a href=\"/rules/235\">critical specialization</a>. Similarly, you can't load or reload a spellgun, affix <a href=\"/traits/155\">talismans</a> to one, make a spellgun Strike as part of an action that lets you make a firearm Strike, and so on.</p>\n"
